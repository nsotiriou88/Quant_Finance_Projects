Excluding interest, current financing obligations of $196 million and $266 million are recorded within \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d and $6.2 billion and $6.7 billion are recorded within \u201cOther long-term liabilities\u201d as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. The weighted-average remaining term of the financing obligations was 18.8 years and 17.9 years and the weighted-average imputed interest rate was 3.2% and 3.1% as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. (2) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. (3) Includes asset retirement obligations, liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year, and the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction. (4) Excludes approximately $4.0 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any. Suppliers During 2022, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Other Contingencies We are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax controversies typically relate to (i) the taxability of products and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with third parties, and (iii) the adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversies may be materially different from our expectations. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of \u201cinteractive features\u201d on www.amazon.com, including \u201csearch suggestions and search results,\u201d infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled \u201cDistributed Hypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and Display of Embedded Objects Within a Hypermedia Document.\u201d The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $130 to $250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In May 2022, the district court granted summary judgment holding that the patent is invalid. In June 2022, Eolas filed a notice of appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that \u201cAlexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices\u201d infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled \u201cNatural Language Interface Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.\u201d The complaint seeks an injunction, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages , an ongoing royalty, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, both entitled \u201cNetwork Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol\u201d; and 7,233,978, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network Separate from the Data to Which the Location Information Pertains.\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In March 2022, the case was stayed pending resolution of review petitions we filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In November 2022, the stay was lifted. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Beginning in March 2020, with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, private litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and vendors and third-party sellers in Amazon\u2019s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Attorneys General for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the private cases include allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon\u2019s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged actual damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. In March 2022 and January 2023, Amazon\u2019s motions to dismiss were granted in part and denied in part in Frame-Wilson and De Coster v. Amazon.com, Inc. (WD Wash), respectively; both courts dismissed claims alleging that Amazon\u2019s pricing policies are inherently illegal and denied dismissal of claims alleging that Amazon\u2019s pricing policies are an unlawful restraint of trade. In March 2022, the DC Superior Court dismissed the DC Attorney General\u2019s lawsuit in its entirety; the dismissal is under appeal as of January 2023. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In October 2020, BroadbandiTV, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com Services LLC, and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain Amazon Prime Video features and services infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 9,648,388, 10,546,750, and 10,536,751, each entitled \u201cVideo-On-Demand Content Delivery System for Providing Video-On-Demand Services to TV Services Subscribers\u201d; 10,028,026, entitled \u201cSystem for Addressing On-Demand TV Program Content on TV Services Platform of a Digital TV Services Provider\u201d; and 9,973,825, entitled \u201cDynamic Adjustment of Electronic Program Guide Displays Based on Viewer Preferences for Minimizing Navigation in VOD Program Selection.\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages. In April 2022, BroadbandiTV alleged in its damages report that, in the event of a finding of liability, Amazon could be subject to $166 to $986 million in damages. In September 2022, the court granted summary judgment, holding that the patents are invalid. In October 2022, BroadbandiTV filed a notice of appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In November 2020, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that Amazon uses data relating to our marketplace sellers in a manner that infringes EU competition rules. The Statement of Objections sought to impose unspecified fines and remedial actions. In December 2022, the European Commission adopted formal commitments without fines, fully resolving the investigation. In July 2021, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection (the \u201cCNPD\u201d) issued a decision against Amazon Europe Core S.\u00e0 r.l. claiming that Amazon\u2019s processing of personal data did not comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The decision imposes a fine of \u20ac746 million and corresponding practice revisions. We believe the CNPD\u2019s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In November 2021, Jawbone Innovations, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon Echo smart speakers and displays, Fire TV Cube, and Echo Buds infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,246,058, entitled \u201cDetecting Voiced and Unvoiced Speech Using Both Acoustic and Nonacoustic Sensors\u201d; 8,019,091, entitled \u201cVoice Activity Detector (VAD)-Based Multiple-Microphone Acoustic Noise Suppression\u201d; 8,280,072, entitled \u201cMicrophone Array with Rear Venting\u201d; 8,321,213 and 8,326,611, both entitled \u201cAcoustic Voice Activity Detection (AVAD) for Electronic Systems\u201d; 8,467,543, entitled \u201cMicrophone and Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Configurations for Use with Communications Systems\u201d; 8,503,691, entitled \u201cVirtual Microphone Arrays Using Dual Omnidirectional Microphone Array (DOMA)\u201d; 10,779,080, entitled \u201cDual Omnidirectional Microphone Array (DOMA)\u201d; and 11,122,357, entitled \u201cForming Virtual Microphone Arrays Using Dual Omnidirectional Microphone Array (DOMA).\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In November 2022, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the \u201cICA\u201d) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Europe Core S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming that certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringe EU competition rules. The decision imposes remedial actions and a fine of \u20ac1.13 billion, which we are paying and will seek to recover pending conclusion of all appeals. We believe the ICA\u2019s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In July 2022, Acceleration Bay, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Lambda, Amazon Lumberyard, Luna, Amazon Prime Video, Twitch, Amazon GameLift, GridMate, Amazon EKS, AWS App Mesh, and Amazon VPC infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 6,701,344, entitled \u201cDistributed Game Environment\u201d; 6,714,966, entitled \u201cInformation Delivery Service\u201d; 6,732,147, entitled \u201cLeaving a Broadcast Channel\u201d; 6,829,634, entitled \u201cBroadcasting Network\u201d; and 6,910,069, entitled \u201cJoining a Broadcast Channel.\u201d The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In November 2022, LightGuide, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com Services LLC in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon\u2019s Nike Intent Detection System used in certain fulfillment centers infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 7,515,981, entitled \u201cLight Guided Assembly System\u201d; and 9,658,614 and 10,528,036, each entitled \u201cLight Guided Assembly System and Method.\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, li tigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes was 13.1 years as of December 31, 2022. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $53.3 billion and $61.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. We have a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we increased from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in August 2022 and we may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility is available until August 2025, bears interest based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and has a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion. There were $803 million and $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, which had an interest rate of 1.5% and 5.6%, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we have pledged $918 million and $1.2 billion of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.

In March 2022, we increased the size of the Commercial Paper Programs from $10.0 billion to $20.0 billion. There were $725 million and $6.8 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, which were included in \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and had a weighted-average effective interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.08% and 4.47%, respectively. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes. We have a $10.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), which was amended and restated in March 2022 to increase the borrowing capacity from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion and to extend the term to March 2025. It may be extended for up to three additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. In November 2022, we entered into a $10.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the \u201cShort-Term Credit Agreement\u201d), which matures in November 2023 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days if approved by the lenders.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\n Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company\u2019s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position\u2019s technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2022, the Company reported accrued liabilities of $4.0 billion for various tax contingencies. \n\nAuditing the recognition and measurement of the Company\u2019s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex and involves significant auditor judgment. Management\u2019s evaluation of tax positions is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings, and may be impacted by regulatory changes and judicial and examination activity. \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the Company\u2019s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over: the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained; the measurement of the benefit of its tax positions, both initially and on an ongoing basis; and the development of the related disclosures. \n\nWe involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company\u2019s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company\u2019s analysis including the Company\u2019s correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. We used our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws of the relevant taxing jurisdictions to evaluate the Company\u2019s accounting for its tax contingencies.

We analyzed the appropriateness of the Company\u2019s assumptions and the accuracy of the Company\u2019s calculations and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize.

Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of \u201cinteractive features\u201d on www.amazon.com, including \u201csearch suggestions and search results,\u201d infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled \u201cDistributed Hypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and Display of Embedded Objects Within A Hypermedia Document.\u201d The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $130-$250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that \u201cAlexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices\u201d infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled \u201cNatural Language Interface Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.\u201d The complaint seeks an injunction, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, an ongoing royalty, pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, both entitled \u201cNetwork Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol,\u201d and 7,233,978, entitled \u201cMethod And Apparatus For Managing Location Information In A Network Separate From The Data To Which The Location Information Pertains.\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Beginning in March 2020, with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, a number of cases have been filed in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and third-party sellers in Amazon\u2019s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Some of the cases include allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon\u2019s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged actual damages, treble damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief. Individuals have also initiated arbitrations based on substantially similar allegations. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In November 2020, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that Amazon uses data relating to our marketplace sellers in a manner that infringes EU competition rules. The Statement of Objections seeks to impose unspecified fines and remedial actions. We disagree with the preliminary assertions of the European Commission and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In July 2021, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection (the \u201cCNPD\u201d) issued a decision against Amazon Europe Core S.\u00e0 r.l. claiming that Amazon\u2019s processing of personal data did not comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The decision imposes a fine of \u20ac746 million and corresponding practice revisions. We believe the CNPD\u2019s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In November 2021, Jawbone Innovations, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon Echo smart speakers and displays, Fire TV Cube, and Echo Buds infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,246,058, entitled \u201cDetecting Voiced and Unvoiced Speech Using Both Acoustic and Nonacoustic Sensors\u201d; 8,019,091, entitled \u201cVoice Activity Detector (VAD)-Based Multiple-Microphone Acoustic Noise Suppression\u201d; 8,280,072, entitled \u201cMicrophone Array with Rear Venting\u201d; 8,321,213 and 8,326,611, both entitled \u201cAcoustic Voice Activity Detection (AVAD) for Electronic Systems\u201d; 8,467,543, entitled \u201cMicrophone and Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Configurations for Use with Communications Systems\u201d; 10,779,080, entitled \u201cDual Omnidirectional Microphone Array (DOMA)\u201d; and 11,122,357, entitled \u201cForming Virtual Microphone Arrays Using Dual Omnidirectional Microphone Array (DOMA).\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the \u201cICA\u201d) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Europe Core S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming that certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringed EU competition rules. The decision imposes a fine of \u20ac1.13 billion and remedial actions. We believe the ICA\u2019s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In January 2022, VideoLabs, Inc. and VL Collective IP LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Glow, Amazon Echo Show, Fire TV, Fire TV Cube, Fire TV Stick, Fire Tablets, AWS Elemental MediaConvert, AWS Elemental Live, AWS Elemental Server, AWS Elemental MediaPackage, AWS Elemental MediaLive, and Amazon Elastic Transcoder infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,769,238 and 8,139,878, both entitled \u201cPicture Coding Method and Picture Decoding Method\u201d; and 7,970,059, entitled \u201cVariable Length Coding Method and Variable Length Decoding Method\u201d; that Amazon Prime Video, AWS Elemental MediaConvert, AWS Elemental Live, AWS Elemental Server, AWS Elemental MediaPackage, AWS Elemental MediaLive, Amazon Elastic Transcoder, and Amazon Kinesis Video Streams infringe U.S. Patent No. 8,605,794, entitled \u201cMethod for Synchronizing Content-Dependent Data Segments of Files\u201d; that Amazon Echo Show, Amazon Echo Spot, Amazon Connect, Amazon Chime, and Amazon Kinesis Video Streams infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,266,682, entitled \u201cMethod and System for Transmitting Data from a Transmitter to a Receiver and Transmitter and Receiver Therefore\u201d; that AWS Auto Scaling and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,880,156, entitled \u201cDemand Responsive Method and Apparatus to Automatically Activate Spare Servers\u201d; and that Amazon Prime Video infringes U.S. Patent No. 7,440,559, entitled \u201cSystem and Associated Terminal, Method and Computer Program Product for Controlling the Flow of Content.\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 3, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\n Income Taxes Description of the Matter As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company\u2019s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position\u2019s technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. \n\nAuditing the recognition and measurement of the Company\u2019s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex and involves significant auditor judgment. Management\u2019s evaluation of tax positions may involve the use of valuation methodologies and assumptions, including forecasts of income or loss, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the Company\u2019s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained; measurement of the benefit of its tax positions, including the selection of valuation methodologies and assumptions; determination of forecasts of income or loss; and development of the related disclosures. \n\nWe involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company\u2019s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company\u2019s analysis including the Company\u2019s correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. We used our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Company\u2019s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the Company\u2019s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the appropriateness of the Company\u2019s valuation methodologies and assumptions, including the determination of forecasts of income or loss, and the accuracy of the Company\u2019s calculations and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize. We have also evaluated the Company\u2019s income tax disclosures in relation to these matters. \n\n\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1996. \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nFebruary 3, 2022 \n\nAMAZON.COM, INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS \n\n(in millions) \n\n \n\n\u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872422000005/amzn-20211231.htm"}, "2020": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": NaN, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments We have entered into non-cancellable operating and finance leases and financing obligations for equipment and office, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, data center, physical store, and renewable energy facilities.

We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Other Contingencies We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, including interest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on transactions by our third-party sellers. In September 2019, the South Carolina Administrative Law Court ruled in favor of the Department of Revenue and we have appealed the decision to the state Court of Appeals. We believe the assessment is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If other tax authorities were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: In March 2015, Zitovault, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com, LLC, Amazon Web Services, Inc., and Amazon Web Services, LLC for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that Elastic Compute Cloud, Virtual Private Cloud, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto-Scaling, and Elastic Beanstalk infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,484,257, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Maintaining N Number of Simultaneous Cryptographic Sessions Using a Distributed Computing Environment.\u201d The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and interest. In January 2016, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. In June 2016, the case was stayed pending resolution of a review petition we filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In January 2019, the stay of the case was lifted following resolution of the review petition. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of \u201cinteractive features\u201d on www.amazon.com, including \u201csearch suggestions and search results,\u201d infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled \u201cDistributed Hypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and Display of Embedded Objects Within A Hypermedia Document.\u201d The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $130-$250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that \u201cAlexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices\u201d infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled \u201cNatural Language Interface Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.\u201d The complaint seeks an injunction, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, an ongoing royalty, pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, both entitled \u201cNetwork Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol,\u201d and 7,233,978, entitled \u201cMethod And Apparatus For Managing Location Information In A Network Separate From The Data To Which The Location Information Pertains.\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Beginning in March 2020, a number of class-action complaints were filed alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and third-party sellers in Amazon\u2019s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization of an alleged market in online retail or other submarkets, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. In March 2020, Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. Beginning in April 2020, class action complaints were filed in the Superior Court of Quebec \u2013 Division of Montreal, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, and the Federal Court of Canada against Amazon.com, Inc. and related entities. The complaints allege several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon\u2019s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged actual damages, treble damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In November 2020, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that Amazon uses data relating to our marketplace sellers in a manner that infringes EU competition rules. The Statement of Objections seeks to impose unspecified fines and remedial actions. We disagree with the preliminary assertions of the European Commission and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The combined weighted average remaining life of the Notes was 15.8 years as of December 31, 2020. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $26.2 billion and $37.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. In October 2016, we entered into a $500 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we subsequently increased to $740 million and may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility is available until October 2022, bears interest at the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus 1.40%, and has a commitment fee of 0.50% on the undrawn portion. There were $740 million and $338 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, which had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.4% and 3.0%, respectively.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 2, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\n Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and, as discussed in Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements, during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company\u2019s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position\u2019s technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2020, the Company accrued liabilities of $2.8 billion for various tax contingencies. \n\nAuditing the measurement of the Company\u2019s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. \n\n\n\n How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the Company\u2019s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, management\u2019s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. \n\nWe involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company\u2019s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company\u2019s analysis including the Company\u2019s correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. We used our knowledge of, and experience with, international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Company\u2019s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the Company\u2019s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the Company\u2019s assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize and tested the accuracy of the Company\u2019s calculations. We have also evaluated the Company\u2019s income tax disclosures included in Note 9 in relation to these matters. \n\n\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1996. \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nFebruary 2, 2021 \n\nAMAZON.COM, INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS \n\n(in millions) \n\n \n\n\u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872421000004/amzn-20201231.htm"}, "2019": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": NaN, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments We have entered into non-cancellable operating and finance leases and financing obligations for equipment and office, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, data center, physical store, and renewable energy facilities.

Pledged Assets As of December 31, 2018 and 2019 , we have pledged or otherwise restricted $575 million and $994 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and certain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. Additionally, we have pledged our cash and seller receivables for debt related to our Credit Facility. See \u201cNote 6 \u2014 Debt.\u201d Suppliers During 2019 , no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Other Contingencies In 2016, we determined that we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The consumer products included books, music, other media, apparel, home and kitchen, health and beauty, jewelry, office, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Our review is ongoing and we have voluntarily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result in the imposition of penalties. For additional information, see Item 9B of Part II, \u201cOther Information \u2014 Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.\u201d We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, including interest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on transactions by our third-party sellers. In September 2019, the South Carolina Administrative Law Court ruled in favor of the Department of Revenue and we have appealed the decision to the state Court of Appeals. We believe the assessment is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If other tax authorities were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: Beginning in August 2013, a number of complaints were filed alleging, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries failed to compensate hourly workers for time spent waiting in security lines and otherwise violated federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law. In August 2013, Busk v. Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and Vance v. Amazon.com, Inc., Zappos.com Inc., another affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Kelly Services, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. In September 2013, Allison v. Amazon.com, Inc. and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, and Johnson v. Amazon.com, Inc. and an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. In October 2013, Davis v. Amazon.com, Inc., an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiffs variously purport to represent a nationwide class of certain current and former employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and/or state-law-based subclasses for certain current and former employees in states including Arizona, California, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, and Nevada, and one complaint asserts nationwide breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. The complaints seek an unspecified amount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys\u2019 fees. We have been named in several other similar cases. In December 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that time spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the federal wage and hour statute. In February 2015, the courts in those actions alleging only federal law claims entered stipulated orders dismissing those actions without prejudice. In March 2016, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Vance case with prejudice. In April 2016, the plaintiffs appealed the district court\u2019s judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s decision. In June 2017, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Busk and Saldana cases with prejudice. We dispute any remaining allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In March 2015, Zitovault, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com, LLC, Amazon Web Services, Inc., and Amazon Web Services, LLC for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.

In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $130 - $250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In October 2017, SRC Labs, LLC and Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe filed a complaint for patent infringement against Amazon Web Services, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., and VADATA, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain AWS EC2 Instances infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 6,434,687, entitled \u201cSystem and method for accelerating web site access and processing utilizing a computer system incorporating reconfigurable processors operating under a single operating system image\u201d; 7,149,867, entitled \u201cSystem and method of enhancing efficiency and utilization of memory bandwidth in reconfigurable hardware\u201d; 7,225,324 and 7,620,800, both entitled \u201cMulti-adaptive processing systems and techniques for enhancing parallelism and performance of computational functions\u201d; and 9,153,311, entitled \u201cSystem and method for retaining DRAM data when reprogramming reconfigurable devices with DRAM memory controllers.\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, interest, and a compulsory on-going royalty.

In November 2018, the case was stayed pending resolution of eight review petitions filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office relating to the \u2018324, \u2018867, and \u2018311 patents. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.

The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $24.3 billion and $26.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 , which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. In October 2016, we entered into a $500 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables , which we subsequently increased to $740 million and may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d).

(the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 30, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nAdoption of New Accounting Standard \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method for accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\n Uncertain Tax Positions \n\nDescription of the Matter \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and, as discussed in Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements, during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company\u2019s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position\u2019s technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2019, the Company accrued liabilities of $3.9 billion for various tax contingencies. \n\nAuditing the measurement of the Company\u2019s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. \n\n\n\n How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit \n\nWe tested controls over the Company\u2019s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, management\u2019s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. \n\nWe involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company\u2019s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company\u2019s analysis including the Company\u2019s correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. We used our knowledge of, and experience with, international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Company\u2019s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the Company\u2019s positions. We analyzed the Company\u2019s assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize and tested the accuracy of the Company\u2019s calculations. We have also evaluated the Company\u2019s income tax disclosures included in Note 9 in relation to these matters. \n\n\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1996. \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nJanuary 30, 2020 \n\nAMAZON.COM, INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS \n\n(in millions) \n\n \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872420000004/amzn-20191231x10k.htm"}, "2018": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": NaN, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments We have entered into non-cancellable operating, capital, and finance leases for equipment and office, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, data center, physical store, and renewable energy facilities.

For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified.

Pledged Assets As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , we have pledged or otherwise restricted $1.4 billion and $575 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and certain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. Suppliers During 2018 , no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Other Contingencies In 2016, we determined that we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The consumer products included books, music, other media, apparel, home and kitchen, health and beauty, jewelry, office, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Our review is ongoing and we have voluntarily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result in the imposition of penalties. For additional information, see Item 9B of Part II, \u201cOther Information \u2014 Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.\u201d We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, including interest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on transactions by our third-party sellers. We believe the assessment is without merit. If South Carolina or other states were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: In November 2007, an Austrian copyright collection society, Austro-Mechana, filed lawsuits against Amazon.com International Sales, Inc., Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon.de GmbH, Amazon.com GmbH, and Amazon Logistik in the Commercial Court of Vienna, Austria and in the District Court of Munich, Germany seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by our EU-based retail websites to customers located in Austria. In July 2008, the German court stayed the German case pending a final decision in the Austrian case. In July 2010, the Austrian court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We contested Austro-Mechana\u2019s claim and in September 2010 commenced an appeal in the Commercial Court of Vienna. We lost this appeal and in March 2011 commenced an appeal in the Supreme Court of Austria. In October 2011, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case to the European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d). In July 2013, the ECJ ruled that EU law does not preclude application of the tariff where certain conditions are met and directed the case back to the Austrian Supreme Court for further proceedings. In October 2013, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further fact finding to determine whether the tariff on blank digital media meets the conditions set by the ECJ. In August 2015, the Commercial Court of Vienna ruled that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana\u2019s claims. In September 2015, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna. In December 2015, the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna confirmed that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana\u2019s appeal. In February 2016, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Austrian Supreme Court. In March 2017, the Austrian Supreme Court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further proceedings. A number of additional actions have been filed making similar allegations. In December 2012, a German copyright collection society, Zentralstelle f\u00fcr private \u00dcberspielungsrechte (\u201cZPU\u201d), filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Media EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Services Europe S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Payments Europe SCA, Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, and Amazon Eurasia Holdings S.\u00e0 r.l. in the District Court of Luxembourg seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.de retail website to customers located in Germany. In January 2013, a Belgian copyright collection society, AUVIBEL, filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l. in the Court of First Instance of Brussels, Belgium, seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.fr retail website to customers located in Belgium. In November 2013, the Belgian court ruled in favor of AUVIBEL and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. Beginning in August 2013, a number of complaints were filed alleging, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries failed to compensate hourly workers for time spent waiting in security lines and otherwise violated federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law. In August 2013, Busk v. Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and Vance v. Amazon.com, Inc., Zappos.com Inc., another affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Kelly Services, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. In September 2013, Allison v. Amazon.com, Inc. and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, and Johnson v.

(3) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores and long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified.

(5) Excludes $2.3 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any. Pledged Assets As of December 31, 2016 and 2017 , we have pledged or otherwise restricted $715 million and $1.4 billion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and certain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, workers\u2019 compensation obligations, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. Suppliers During 2017 , no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Other Contingencies In 2016, we determined that we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The consumer products included books, music, other media, apparel, home and kitchen, health and beauty, jewelry, office, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Our review is ongoing and we have voluntarily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result in the imposition of penalties. For additional information, see Item 9B of Part II, \u201cOther Information \u2014 Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.\u201d We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, including interest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on transactions by our third-party sellers. We believe the assessment is without merit. If South Carolina or other states were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: In November 2007, an Austrian copyright collection society, Austro-Mechana, filed lawsuits against Amazon.com International Sales, Inc., Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon.de GmbH, Amazon.com GmbH, and Amazon Logistik in the Commercial Court of Vienna, Austria and in the District Court of Munich, Germany seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by our EU-based retail websites to customers located in Austria. In July 2008, the German court stayed the German case pending a final decision in the Austrian case. In July 2010, the Austrian court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We contested Austro-Mechana\u2019s claim and in September 2010 commenced an appeal in the Commercial Court of Vienna. We lost this appeal and in March 2011 commenced an appeal in the Supreme Court of Austria. In October 2011, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case to the European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d). In July 2013, the ECJ ruled that EU law does not preclude application of the tariff where certain conditions are met and directed the case back to the Austrian Supreme Court for further proceedings. In October 2013, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further fact finding to determine whether the tariff on blank digital media meets the conditions set by the ECJ. In August 2015, the Commercial Court of Vienna ruled that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana\u2019s claims. In September 2015, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna. In December 2015, the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna confirmed that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana\u2019s appeal. In February 2016, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Austrian Supreme Court. In March 2017, the Austrian Supreme Court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further proceedings. A number of additional actions have been filed making similar allegations. In December 2012, a German copyright collection society, Zentralstelle f\u00fcr private \u00dcberspielungsrechte (\u201cZPU\u201d), filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Media EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Services Europe S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Payments Europe SCA, Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, and Amazon Eurasia Holdings S.\u00e0 r.l. in the District Court of Luxembourg seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.de retail website to customers located in Germany.

In November 2013, the Belgian court ruled in favor of AUVIBEL and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.

In July 2008, the German court stayed the German case pending a final decision in the Austrian case. In July 2010, the Austrian court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We contested Austro-Mechana\u2019s claim and in September 2010 commenced an appeal in the Commercial Court of Vienna. We lost this appeal and in March 2011 commenced an appeal in the Supreme Court of Austria. In October 2011, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case to the European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d). In July 2013, the ECJ ruled that EU law does not preclude application of the tariff where certain conditions are met and directed the case back to the Austrian Supreme Court for further proceedings. In October 2013, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further fact finding to determine whether the tariff on blank digital media meets the conditions set by the ECJ. In August 2015, the Commercial Court of Vienna ruled that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana\u2019s claims. In September 2015, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna. In December 2015, the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna confirmed that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana\u2019s appeal. In February 2016, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Austrian Supreme Court. A number of additional actions have been filed making similar allegations. In December 2012, a German copyright collection society, Zentralstelle f\u00fcr private \u00dcberspielungsrechte (\u201cZPU\u201d), filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Media EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Services Europe S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Payments Europe SCA, Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, and Amazon Eurasia Holdings S.\u00e0 r.l. in the District Court of Luxembourg seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.de retail website to customers located in Germany. In January 2013, a Belgian copyright collection society, AUVIBEL, filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l. in the Court of First Instance of Brussels, Belgium, seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.fr retail website to customers located in Belgium. In November 2013, the Belgian court ruled in favor of AUVIBEL and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In May 2009, Big Baboon, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Payments, Inc. for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint alleges, among other things, that our third-party selling and payments technology infringes patents owned by Big Baboon, Inc. purporting to cover an \u201cIntegrated Business-to-Business Web Commerce And Business Automation System\u201d (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,115,690 and 6,343,275) and seeks injunctive relief, monetary damages, treble damages, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees. In February 2011, the court entered an order staying the lawsuit pending the outcome of the United States Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s re-examination of the patent. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In June 2012, Hand Held Products, Inc., a subsidiary of Honeywell, filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., AMZN Mobile, LLC, AmazonFresh, LLC, A9.com, Inc., A9 Innovations, LLC, and Quidsi, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of mobile barcode reader applications, including Amazon Mobile, Amazon Price Check, Flow, and AmazonFresh, infringes U.S. Patent No. 6,015,088, entitled \u201cDecoding Of Real Time Video Imaging.\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, interest, and an injunction. In March 2016, the district court granted our motion for summary judgment of non-infringement and dismissed the case with prejudice. In April 2016, Hand Held Products appealed the district court\u2019s judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Beginning in August 2013, a number of complaints were filed alleging, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries failed to compensate hourly workers for time spent waiting in security lines and otherwise violated federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law. In August 2013, Busk v. Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and Vance v.

Amazon.com, Inc., an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiffs variously purport to represent a nationwide class of certain current and former employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and/or state-law-based subclasses for certain current and former employees in states including Arizona, California, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, and Nevada, and one complaint asserts nationwide breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. The complaints seek an unspecified amount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys\u2019 fees. We have been named in several other similar cases. In December 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that time spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the federal wage and hour statute. In February 2015, the courts in those actions alleging only federal law claims entered stipulated orders dismissing those actions without prejudice. In March 2016, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Vance case with prejudice. In April 2016, the plaintiffs appealed the district court\u2019s judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We dispute any remaining allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In September 2013, Personalized Media Communications, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Web Services, LLC in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.

In December 2016, the court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s decision. In January 2017, Personalized Media filed a petition for rehearing en banc. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.

Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: In November 2007, an Austrian copyright collection society, Austro-Mechana, filed lawsuits against Amazon.com International Sales, Inc., Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon.de GmbH, Amazon.com GmbH, and Amazon Logistik in the Commercial Court of Vienna, Austria and in the District Court of Munich, Germany seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by our EU-based retail websites to customers located in Austria. In July 2008, the German court stayed the German case pending a final decision in the Austrian case. In July 2010, the Austrian court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We contested Austro-Mechana\u2019s claim and in September 2010 commenced an appeal in the Commercial Court of Vienna. We lost this appeal and in March 2011 commenced an appeal in the Supreme Court of Austria. In October 2011, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case to the European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d). In July 2013, the ECJ ruled that EU law does not preclude application of the tariff where certain conditions are met and directed the case back to the Austrian Supreme Court for further proceedings. In October 2013, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further fact finding to determine whether the tariff on blank digital media meets the conditions set by the ECJ. In August 2015, the Commercial Court of Vienna ruled that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana\u2019s claims. In September 2015, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna. In December 2015, the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna confirmed that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana\u2019s appeal. A number of additional actions have been filed making similar allegations. In December 2012, a German copyright collection society, Zentralstelle f\u00fcr private \u00dcberspielungsrechte (\u201cZPU\u201d), filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Media EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Services Europe S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Payments Europe SCA, Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, and Amazon Eurasia Holdings S.\u00e0 r.l. in the District Court of Luxembourg seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.de retail website to customers located in Germany. In January 2013, a Belgian copyright collection society, AUVIBEL, filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l. in the Court of First Instance of Brussels, Belgium, seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.fr retail website to customers located in Belgium. In November 2013, the Belgian court ruled in favor of AUVIBEL and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In May 2009, Big Baboon, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Payments, Inc. for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint alleges, among other things, that our third-party selling and payments technology infringes patents owned by Big Baboon, Inc. purporting to cover an \u201cIntegrated Business-to-Business Web Commerce And Business Automation System\u201d (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,115,690 and 6,343,275) and seeks injunctive relief, monetary damages, treble damages, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees. In February 2011, the court entered an order staying the lawsuit pending the outcome of the Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s re-examination of the patent. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In June 2012, Hand Held Products, Inc., a subsidiary of Honeywell, filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., AMZN Mobile, LLC, AmazonFresh, LLC, A9.com, Inc., A9 Innovations, LLC, and Quidsi, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of mobile barcode reader applications, including Amazon Mobile, Amazon Price Check, Flow, and AmazonFresh, infringes U.S. Patent No. 6,015,088, entitled \u201cDecoding Of Real Time Video Imaging.\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, interest, and an injunction. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In July 2012, Norman Blagman filed a purported class-action complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. for copyright infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. sells digital music in our Amazon MP3 Store obtained from defendant Orchard Enterprises and other unnamed \u201cdigital music aggregators\u201d without obtaining mechanical licenses for the compositions embodied in that music. The complaint seeks certification as a class action, statutory damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, and interest. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In November 2012, Lexington Luminance LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Digital Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain light-emitting diodes in certain Kindle devices infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,936,851, entitled \u201cSemiconductor Light-Emitting Device And Method For Manufacturing Same.\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages and an injunction or, in the absence of an injunction, a compulsory ongoing royalty. In March 2014, the court invalidated the plaintiff\u2019s patent and dismissed the case with prejudice, and the plaintiff appealed the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In February 2015, the Federal Circuit reversed the judgment of the district court. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Beginning in August 2013, a number of complaints were filed alleging, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries failed to compensate hourly workers for time spent waiting in security lines and otherwise violated federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law. In August 2013, Busk v. Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and Vance v.

Amazon.com, Inc. and an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. In October 2013, Davis v. Amazon.com, Inc., an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiffs variously purport to represent a nationwide class of certain current and former employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and/or state-law-based subclasses for certain current and former employees in states including Arizona, California, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, and Nevada, and one complaint asserts nationwide breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. The complaints seek an unspecified amount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys\u2019 fees. We have been named in several other similar cases. In December 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that time spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the federal wage and hour statute. In February 2015, the courts in those actions alleging only federal law claims entered stipulated orders dismissing those actions without prejudice. We dispute any remaining allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In September 2013, Personalized Media Communications, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Web Services, LLC in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.

In August 2015, the court invalidated all asserted claims of all asserted patents and dismissed the case with prejudice.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nIncurred but not Reported (IBNR) Claim Liability - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements. \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nMedical costs payable includes estimates of the Company\u2019s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. These estimates are referred to as incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim liabilities. At December 31, 2022, the Company\u2019s IBNR balance was $20 billion. The Company develops IBNR estimates using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management include medical cost per member per month trend factors and completion factors, which include assumptions over the time from date of service to claim receipt, the impact of actual care activity, and processing cycles. \n\nWe identified the IBNR claim liability as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions made by management in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s methods, assumptions and judgments in developing the liability. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures included the following, among others: \n\n\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls over management\u2019s estimate of the IBNR claim liability balance, including controls over the judgments in both the completion factors and the medical cost per member per month trend factors, as well as controls over the claims and membership data used in the estimation process. \n\n\u2022 We tested the underlying claims and membership data and other information that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate. \n\n\u2022 With the assistance of actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the actuarial methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the IBNR claim liability by: \n\n\u25e6 Performing an overlay of the historical claims data used in management\u2019s current year model to the data used in prior periods to validate that there were no material changes to the claims data tested in prior periods. \n\n\u25e6 Developing an independent estimate of the IBNR claim liability and comparing our estimate to management\u2019s estimate. \n\n\u25e6 Performing a retrospective review comparing management\u2019s prior year estimate of IBNR to claims processed in 2022 with dates of service in 2021 or prior. \n\n \n\n/ S / DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP \n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota February 24, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002. \n\nUnitedHealth Group \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets  (in millions, except per share data) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 23,365 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/731766/000073176623000008/unh-20221231.htm"}, "2021": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": NaN, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": NaN, "external_audit": "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ( PCAOB ID No 34 ) \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n\nConsolidated Statements of Operations \n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income \n\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity \n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows \n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n1.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 15, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit and finance committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nIncurred but not Reported (IBNR) Claim Liability - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements. \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nMedical costs payable includes estimates of the Company\u2019s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. These estimates are referred to as incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim liabilities. At December 31, 2021 the Company\u2019s IBNR balance was $17 billion. The Company develops IBNR estimates using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management include medical cost per member per month trend factors and completion factors, which include assumptions over the time from date of service to claim receipt, the impact of claim levels, processing cycles, and consideration of COVID-19. \n\nWe identified the IBNR claim liability as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions made by management in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s methods, assumptions and judgments in developing the liability. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures included the following, among others: \n\n\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls over management\u2019s estimate of the IBNR claim liability balance, including controls over the judgments in both the completion factors and the medical cost per member per month trend factors, as well as controls over the claims and membership data used in the estimation process. \n\n\u2022 We tested the underlying claims and membership data and other information that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate. \n\n\u2022 With the assistance of actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the actuarial methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the IBNR claim liability by: \n\n\u25e6 Performing an overlay of the historical claims data used in management\u2019s current year model to the data used in prior periods to validate that there were no material changes to the claims data tested in prior periods. \n\n\u25e6 Developing an independent estimate of the IBNR claim liability and comparing our estimate to management\u2019s estimate. \n\n\u25e6 Performing a retrospective review comparing management\u2019s prior year estimate of IBNR to claims processed in 2021 with dates of service in 2020 or prior. \n\nGoodwill - Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements. \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s goodwill balance was $76 billion. As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, for reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company performs an annual impairment test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill. The estimates of the reporting unit fair values are calculated using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. The discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about revenue trends, medical cost trends, and operating costs as well as discount rates. The market-based method requires determination of an appropriate group of peer companies whose securities are traded on an active market. The annual impairment test indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values as of the impairment testing date; therefore, no impairment was recognized. \n\nWe identified a critical audit matter related to the quantitative analysis performed for such reporting units because of the significant assumptions made by management to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. This required increased auditor judgment and extent of effort, including involvement of fair value specialists to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates and assumptions related to peer company selection and financial projections, which can be impacted by regulatory and macro-economic factors. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the valuation, business, and market assumptions including the discount rate, financial forecasts, and peer group used by management to estimate the fair value of reporting units where a quantitative analysis was performed, included the following, among others: \n\n\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls over management\u2019s annual goodwill impairment assessment, including those over the determination of the fair value such as controls related to management\u2019s financial forecasts, as well as controls over the selection of discount rates, company specific risks, peer companies, and market multiples. \n\n\u2022 We evaluated management\u2019s ability to forecast and meet future revenue, medical cost trend, and operating costs by comparing: \n\n\u25e6 Actual results to historical forecasts. \n\n\u25e6 Forecasted information to: internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, industry and economic trends, and analyst reports of revenue and earnings expectations for the Company and its peers. \n\n\u2022 We evaluated the impact of changes in management\u2019s forecasts from the October 1, 2021 annual measurement date to December 31, 2021. \n\n\u2022 We evaluated management\u2019s selection of peer companies and market multiples. \n\n\u2022 With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of (1) the valuation methodologies, including testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, (2) the weighting of such valuation methodologies, and (3) discount rate and company specific risks by: \n\n\u25e6 Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation. \n\n\u25e6 Developing a range of independent discount rate estimates and comparing to those selected by management. \n\n \n\n/ S / DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP \n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota February 15, 2022 \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002. \n\nUnitedHealth Group \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n\n (in millions, except per share data) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 21,375 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/731766/000073176622000008/unh-20211231.htm"}, "2020": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": NaN, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": NaN, "external_audit": "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n\nConsolidated Statements of Operations \n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income \n\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity \n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows \n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n1.

of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations: Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (the \"Company\"), a global professional services firm, is organized based on the different services that it offers. Under this structure, the Company\u2019s two business segments are Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. The Risk and Insurance Services segment (\"RIS\") provides risk management solutions (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation) as well as insurance and reinsurance broking and services for businesses, public entities, insurance companies, associations, professional services organizations, and private clients. The Company conducts business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Marsh provides data-driven risk advisory services and solutions to commercial and consumer clients. Guy Carpenter develops advanced risk, reinsurance and capital strategies that help clients grow profitably and identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities. The Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. Mercer delivers advice and solutions that help organizations create a dynamic world of work, shape retirement and investment outcomes, and unlock health and well being for a changing workforce. Oliver Wyman Group serves as critical strategic, economic and brand advisor to private sector and governmental clients. Business Update Related To COVID-19 The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. For almost two years, the pandemic has impacted businesses globally including virtually every geography in which the Company operates. Our businesses have been resilient throughout the pandemic and demand for our advice and services remains strong as the global economic conditions continue to improve. Although the majority of our colleagues continue to work remotely, the Company has provided guidelines on return to the office depending on the level of virus containment and local health and safety regulations in each geography. The safety and well-being of our colleagues is paramount and the Company expects to continue to service clients effectively in both the remote and in-office environments. The Company had strong revenue growth in 2021 and benefited from the continued recovery of the global economy. However, uncertainty remains in the economic outlook and the ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 to the Company will depend on future developments that it is unable to predict, including new \"waves\" of infection from emerging variants of the virus, potential renewed restrictions and mandates by various governments or agencies, and the distribution and uptake of vaccines and vaccine boosters. Acquisition of JLT On April 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition (the \"Transaction\") of all of the outstanding shares of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc (\"JLT\"), a public company organized under the laws of England and Wales. JLT's results of operations for the period April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 are included in the Company\u2019s results of operations for 2019. Prior to being acquired by the Company, JLT operated in three segments: Specialty, Reinsurance and Employee Benefits. JLT operated in 41 countries, with significant revenue in the United Kingdom, Pacific, Asia and the United States. As of April 1, 2019, the historical JLT businesses were combined into MMC operations as follows: JLT Specialty is included by geography within Marsh, JLT Reinsurance is included in Guy Carpenter and the majority of JLT's Employee Benefits business is included in Mercer Health and Wealth. The Company is expected to complete the integration of JLT during 2022. Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Revenue: The Company provides detailed discussion regarding its revenue policies in Note 2, Revenue. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of certificates of deposit and time deposits, with original maturities of three months or less, and money market funds. The estimated fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value. The Company is required to maintain operating funds primarily related to regulatory requirements outside the United States or as collateral under captive insurance arrangements. The Company maintained $303 million and $270 million related to these regulatory requirements at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Fixed Assets: Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized. Upon sale or retirement of an asset, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of buildings, building improvements, furniture, and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets. Furniture and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods covered by the applicable leases or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is less. Buildings are depreciated over periods ranging from 30 to 40 years. The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. The components of fixed assets are as follows: December 31, (In millions) 2021 2020 Furniture and equipment $ 811 $ 1,326 Land and buildings 385 379 Leasehold and building improvements 1,240 1,310 2,436 3,015 Less-accumulated depreciation and amortization (1,589) (2,159) $ 847 $ 856 Investments: The caption \"Investm ent income (loss)\" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized g ains and losses from investments recognized in earnings. It includes, when applicable, other than temporary declines in the value of securities, mark-to-market increases or decreases in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity method gains or losses on the Company's investments in private equity funds. The Company holds investments in certain private equity funds. Investments in private equity funds are accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting using a consistently applied three-month lag period adjusted for any known significant changes from the lag period to the reporting date of the Company. The underlying private equity funds follow investment company accounting, where investments within the fund are carried at fair value. Investment gains or losses for its proportionate share of the change in fair value of the funds are recorded in earnings. Investments using the equity method of accounting are included in \"other assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets. In 2021, the Company recorded investment income of $61 million compared to an investment loss of $22 million in 2020 and investment income of $22 million in 2019. Investment income in 2021 is primarily due to gains from investments in private equity funds. The net investment loss in 2020 is primarily due to the loss on the sale of shares of Alexander Forbes (\"AF\"). The investment gain in 2019 includes gains of $10 million related to mark-to-market changes in equity securities and gains of $12 million related to investments in private equity funds and other investments. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment. The Company performs an annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. A company can assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a goodwill impairment test. Alternatively, a company may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. When a quantitative test is performed, fair values of the reporting units are estimated using either a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter-end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit le vel. As discussed in Note 6, Goodwill and Other Intangibles, the Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment during 2021. Oth er intangible assets, which primarily consist of acquired customer lists, that are not deemed to have an indefinite life, are amortized over their estimated lives, typically ranging from 10 to 15 years, and assessed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events in accordance with applicable accounting literature. The Company had no indefinite lived identified intangible assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Retirement Benefits: T he Company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its U.S. and non-U.S. eligible employees. The Company\u2019s policy for funding its tax qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth by U.S. law and the laws of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Company offers defined benefit plans. The net periodic cost of the Company\u2019s defined benefit plans is measured on an actuarial basis using various methods and assumptions. The Company uses actuaries from Mercer, a subsidiary of the Company, to perform valuations of its pension plans. The long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of each plan's assets. The Company utilizes a model developed by the Mercer actuaries to assist in the determination of this assumption. The model takes into account several factors, including: actual and target portfolio allocation; investment, administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust; historical portfolio performance; relevant forward-looking economic analysis; and expected returns, variances and correlations for different asset classes. These measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio. Generally, the Company does not adjust the rate of return assumption from year to year if, at the measurement date, it is within the range between the 25th and 75th percentile of the expected long-term annual returns. Historical long-term average asset returns of the most significant plans are also reviewed to determine whether they are consistent and reasonable compared with the rate selected. The expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the assumed long-term rate of return to the market-related value of plan assets. This market-related value recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future market-related value of the assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are reflected. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and modifies these assumptions based on current rates and trends. The funded status of the Company's pension plans is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets and provides for a delayed recognition of actuarial gains or losses arising from changes in the projected benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rates, differences between the actual and expected value of plan assets and other assumption changes. The unrecognized pension plan actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs not yet recognized in net periodic pension cost are recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\"AOCI\"), net of tax. These gains and losses are amortized prospectively out of AOCI over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive, or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants. The vast majority of unrecognized losses relate to inactive plans and are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants. The discount rate selected for each U.S. plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan. Discount rates for non-U.S. plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration; in the U.K., the plan duration is reflected using the Mercer yield curve. Defined Benefit Pension Plans in the U.K. and certain other countries allow participants an option for the payment of a lump sum distribution from plan assets before retirement in full satisfaction of the retirement benefits due to the participant as well as any survivor\u2019s benefit. The Company\u2019s policy is to treat these lump sum payments as a partial settlement of the plan liability if they exceed the total of interest plus service costs (\"settlement thresholds\"). See Note 8, Retirement Benefits for additional information. Leases: A lease is defined as a party obtaining the right to use an asset legally owned by another party. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities are recorded at the lease commencement date. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the contractual fixed lease payments. The Company uses discount rates to determine the present value of future lease payments. The Company primarily uses its incremental borrowing rate adjusted to reflect a secured rate, based on the information available for leases, including the lease term and interest rate environment in the country in which the lease exists. The lease terms used to calculate the ROU asset and lease liability may include options to extend or terminate when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. ROU assets are recognized equal to lease liabilities, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, initial direct costs and lease incentives. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. Leases are negotiated with third-parties and, in some instances contain renewal, expansion and termination options. The Company also subleases certain office facilities to third-parties when the Company no longer utilizes the space. In addition to the base rental costs, the Company's lease agreements generally provide for rent escalations resulting from increased assessments for real estate taxes and other charges. A portion of our real estate lease portfolio contains base rents subject to annual changes in the Consumer Price Index (\"CPI\") as well as charges for operating expenses which are reimbursable to the landlord based on actual usage. Changes to the CPI and payments for such reimbursable operating expenses are considered variable and are recognized as variable lease costs in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred. Approximately 99% of the Company's lease obligations are for the use of office space. All of the Company's material leases are operating leases. As a practical expedient, the Company has elected an accounting policy not to separate non-lease components from lease components and instead account as a single lease component. The Company has also elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases that, at the commencement date, are for 12 months or less. See Note 12, Leases for additional information . Capitalized Software Costs: The Company capitalizes certain costs to develop, purchase or modify software for the internal use of the Company. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Costs related to updates and enhancements are only capitalized if they will result in additional functionality. Capitalized computer software costs of $475 million and $481 million, net of accumulated amortization of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Legal and Other Loss Contingencies: The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (\"E&O\"). The Company records a liability when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable which requires significant management judgment. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by Oliver Wyman, a subsidiary of the Company, and other methods to estimate potential losses, including estimated legal costs. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could arise from such claims, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period. As of December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s liability for errors and omissions was $434 million, compared to $639 million at December 31, 2020, of which $79 million and $271 million, respectively, were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company\u2019s various insurance programs. The legal and other contingent liabilities described above are not discounted. Income Taxes: The Company's effective tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax provision and in evaluating uncertain tax positions and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Tax law may require items be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the income tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Integration and Restructuring Charges: Severance and related costs are recognized based on amounts due under established severance plans or estimates of one-time benefits that will be provided. Typically, severance benefits are recognized when the impacted colleagues are notified of their expected termination and such termination is expected to occur within the legally required notification period. These costs are included in compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of income. Costs for real estate consolidation are recognized based on the type of cost, and the expected future use of the facility. For locations where the Company does not expect to sub-lease the property, the amortization of any right-of-use asset is accelerated from the decision date to the cease use date. For locations where the Company expects to sub-lease the properties subsequent to its vacating the property, the right-of-use asset is reviewed for potential impairment at the earlier of the cease use date or the date a sub-lease is signed. To determine the amount of impairment, the fair value of the right-of-use asset is determined based on the present value of the estimated net cash flows related to the property. Contractual costs outside of the ROU asset are recognized based on the net present value of expected future cash outflows for which the Company will not receive any benefit. Such amounts are reliant on estimates of future sub-lease income to be received and future contractual costs to be incurred. These costs are included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Other costs related to integration and restructuring, such as moving, legal or consulting costs are recognized as incurred. These costs are included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Derivative Instruments: All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. The fair value of the derivative is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in other receivables or accounts payable and accrued liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. If a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge, the change in fair value is recorded in earnings. Per Share Data: Basic net income per share attributable to the Company is calculated by dividing the after-tax income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Diluted net income per share attributable to the Company is calculated by dividing the after-tax income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, which have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares. Basic and Diluted EPS Calculation (In millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 2019 Net income before non-controlling interests $ 3,174 $ 2,046 $ 1,773 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 31 30 31 Net income attributable to the Company $ 3,143 $ 2,016 $ 1,742 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 507 506 506 Dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares 6 6 5 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 513 512 511 Average stock price used to calculate common stock equivalents $ 141.57 $ 109.12 $ 97.23 Fiduciary Assets and Liabilities: In its capacity as an insurance broker or agent, generally the Company collects premiums from insureds and after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. The Company also collects claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds. Unremitted insurance prem iums and claims proceeds are held by the Company in a fiduciary capacity. Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes interest on fiduciary funds of $15 million, $46 million and $105 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Since cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity are not available for corporate use, they are shown in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables were $13.0 billion and $11.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company is not a principal to the contracts under which the right to receive premiums or the righ t to receive reimbursement of insured losses arises. Accordingly, net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables are not assets and liabilities of the Company and are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In certain instances, the Company advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to collection. These advances are made from corporate funds and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as receivables. The Company, through its Mercer subsidiary, manages assets in trusts or funds for which Mercer\u2019s management or trustee fee is not considered a variable interest, since the fees are commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. Mercer is not the primary beneficiary of these trusts or funds. Mercer\u2019s maximum exposure to loss of its interests is, therefore, limited to collection of its fees. Estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, judgments and methodologies. The estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable. Such matters include: \u2022 estimates of revenue; \u2022 impairment assessments and charges; \u2022 recoverability of long-lived assets; \u2022 liabilities for errors and omissions; \u2022 deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions and income tax expense; \u2022 share-based and incentive compensation expense; \u2022 the allowance for current expected credit losses on receivables; \u2022 useful lives assigned to long-lived assets, and depreciation and amortization; and \u2022 fair value estimates of contingent consideration receivable or payable related to acquisitions or dispositions. The Company believes these estimates are reasonable based on information currently available at the time they are made. The Company also considered potential COVID-19 impacts to its customer base in various industries and geographies. Insurance exposures subject to variable factors are subject to mid-term and end of term adjustments, as well as policy audits, which may reduce premiums and corresponding commissions. Estimates were updated based on internal and industry specific economic data. The ultimate extent to which COVID-19 will directly or indirectly impact the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations and financial condition will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that it is not able to predict. Actual results may differ from these estimates . New Accounting Pronouncement Adopted Effective January 1, 2022: In October, 2021, the FASB issued new guidance for measuring contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. In accordance with the new guidance, contract assets and contract liabilities should be measured in accordance with the guidance for revenue from contracts with customers as opposed to the guidance for business combinations. The guidance must be applied on a prospective basis, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to adopt this new standard effective January 1, 2022. Adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. New Accounting Pro nouncements Adopted Effective January 1, 2021: In January 2020, the FASB issued guidance that addresses accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method and measuring certain purchased options and forward contract to acquire investments. The standard takes effect for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial position or its results of operations. In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance related to the accounting for income taxes. The standard removes specific exceptions in the current rules and eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: (i) exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation; (ii) exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments and (iii) exception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The standard also is designed to improve financial statement preparers\u2019 application of income tax-related guidance and simplify GAAP for (i) franchise taxes that are partially based on income; (ii) transactions with a government that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill; (iii) separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax and (iv) enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. The standard takes effect for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial position or its results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted Effective January 1, 2020: In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance that amends required fair value measurement disclosures.

On April 9, 2021, the Company increased its short-term commercial paper financing program to $2.0 billion from $1.5 billion. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2021. Credit Facilities On April 2, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated multi-currency unsecured $2.8 billion five-year revolving credit facility (\"New Facility\"). The interest rate on the New Facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company\u2019s credit ratings. The New Facility expires in April 2026 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. The New Facility includes provisions for determining a LIBOR successor rate in the event LIBOR reference rates are no longer available or in certain other circumstances which are determined to make using an alternative rate desirable. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no borrowings under this facility. In connection with the New Facility, the Company terminated its previous multi-currency unsecured $1.8 billion five-year revolving credit facility and its unsecured $1 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility. In January 2020, the Company closed on a $500 million one-year and $500 million two-year term loan facilities. In the first quarter of 2020 the Company borrowed $1 billion against these facilities, which were subsequently repaid during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. These two facilities were terminated as of December 31, 2020 after repayment of the initial draw down. Additional credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit are maintained with various banks aggregating $508 million at December 31, 2021 and $573 million at December 31, 2020. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Senior Notes In December 2021, the Company issued $400 million of 2.375% senior notes due 2031 and $350 million of 2.90% senior notes due 2051. The Company used the net proceeds from these issuances for general corporate purposes and repaid $500 million of 2.75% senior notes with an original maturity date of January 2022 in December 2021. On April 15, 2021, the Company repaid $500 million of senior notes maturing in July 2021. In December 2020, the Company repaid $700 million of maturing senior notes. The Company also prepaid $300 million of floating rate notes with an original maturity of December 2021. In May 2020, the Company issued $750 million of 2.250% senior notes due 2030. The Company used the net proceeds from this offering to pay outstanding borrowings under the previous revolving credit facility. In March 2020, the Company repaid $500 million of maturing senior notes. Scheduled repayments of long-term debt in 2022 and in the four succeeding years are $17 million, $616 million, $1.6 billion, $518 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. Fair Value of Short-term and Long-term Debt The estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s short-term and long-term debt is provided below. Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition, nor do they indicate the Company\u2019s intent or need to dispose of the financial instrument.

The estimated fair value of a primary portion of the Company's long-term debt is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Short- and long-term debt would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy."]}, "external_audit": null, "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/62709/000006270922000009/mmc-20211231.htm"}, "2020": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations: Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (the \"Company\"), a global professional services firm, is organized based on the different services that it offers. Under this structure, the Company\u2019s two business segments are Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. The Risk and Insurance Services segment provides risk management solutions, services, advice and insurance broking, reinsurance broking and insurance program management services for businesses, public entities, insurance companies, associations, professional services organizations, and private clients. The Company conducts business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter. The Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, wealth and career consulting services and products. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services. Business Update Related To COVID-19 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the Coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic. The pandemic has impacted essentially every geography in which the Company operates. Governments implemented various restrictions around the world, including closure of non-essential businesses, travel, shelter-in-place requirements for citizens and other restrictions. The Company has taken a number of precautionary steps to safeguard its businesses and colleagues from COVID-19, including implementing travel restrictions, arranging work from home capabilities and flexible work policies. In the second and third quarters of 2020, the Company began re-opening offices in various locations around the world, while ensuring that it continued to adhere to guidelines and orders issued by national, state and local governments. The timing of additional office re-openings will vary based on the conditions and restrictions in each location. In the fourth quarter, there was a surge in COVID-19 infections in many parts of the world, leading to renewed lock-downs and increased government restrictions. The safety and well-being of our colleagues continues to be our first priority. Several vaccines have been or are in various stages of approval. However, the speed of distribution and the impact on colleagues' ability to return to the office remains uncertain. The vast majority of the Company\u2019s colleagues have continued and will continue working in a remote work environment for most of 2021. The Company expects it will continue its ability to service clients effectively while colleagues remain in a remote work environment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s revenue growth, primarily in our businesses that are discretionary in nature, which was partly mitigated through disciplined expense management by implementing restrictions on travel and other cost containment measures. However, the ultimate extent of the COVID-19 impact to the Company will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that it is not able to predict. On April 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition (the \"Transaction\") of all of the outstanding shares of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc (\"JLT\"), a public company organized under the laws of England and Wales. JLT's results of operations for the period April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 are included in the Company\u2019s results of operations for 2019. JLT's results of operations for the period January 1 through March 31, 2019 and for the year ended 2018 are not included in the Company's results of operations and therefore, affect comparability. Prior to being acquired by the Company, JLT operated in three segments: Specialty, Reinsurance and Employee Benefits. JLT operated in 41 countries, with significant revenue in the United Kingdom, Pacific, Asia and the United States. As of April 1, 2019, the historical JLT businesses were combined into MMC operations as follows: JLT Specialty is included by geography within Marsh, JLT Reinsurance is included in Guy Carpenter and the majority of JLT's Employee Benefits business is included in Mercer Health and Wealth. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has substantially integrated JLT into all of its business operations. Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Revenue: The Company provides detailed discussion regarding its revenue policies in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of certificates of deposit and time deposits, with original maturities of three months or less, and money market funds. The estimated fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value. The Company is required to maintain operating funds primarily related to regulatory requirements outside the United States or as collateral under captive insurance arrangements. At December 31, 2020, the Company maintained $270 million related to these regulatory requirements. Fixed Assets: Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized. Upon sale or retirement of an asset, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of buildings, building improvements, furniture, and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets. Furniture and equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from three thirty The components of fixed assets are as follows: December 31, (In millions of dollars) 2020 2019 Furniture and equipment $ 1,326 $ 1,268 Land and buildings 379 377 Leasehold and building improvements 1,310 1,214 3,015 2,859 Less-accumulated depreciation and amortization (2,159) (2,001) $ 856 $ 858 Investments: The caption \"Investment (loss) income\" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments recognized in earnings. It includes, when applicable, other than temporary declines in the value of securities, mark-to-market increases or decreases in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity method gains or losses on the Company's investments in private equity funds. The Company holds investments in certain private equity funds. Investments in private equity funds are accounted for under the equity method of accounting using a consistently applied three-month lag period adjusted for any known significant changes from the lag period to the reporting date of the Company. The underlying private equity funds follow investment company accounting, where investments within the fund are carried at fair value. Investment gains or losses for its proportionate share of the change in fair value of the funds are recorded in earnings. Investments using the equity method of accounting are included in \"other assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets. In 2020, the Company recorded an investment loss of $22 million compared to investment income of $22 million in 2019 and investment loss of $12 million in 2018. The net investment loss in 2020 is primarily due to the $23 million loss from t he sale of shares of AF during the second quarter of 2020. The investment gain in 2019 includes gains of $10 million related to mark-to-market changes in equity securities and gains of $12 million related to investments in private equity funds and other investments. The investment loss in 2018 includes an impairment charge of $83 million related to its investment in AF. The net investment loss in 2018 also includes gains of $54 million related to mark-to-market changes in equity securities and gains of $17 million related to investments in private equity funds and other investments. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment. The Company performs an annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a company can assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a goodwill impairment test. Alternatively, a company may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. When a quantitative test is performed, fair values of the reporting units are estimated using either a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter-end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit le vel. As discussed in Note 6, the Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment during 2020. Oth er intangible assets, which primarily consist of acquired customer lists, that are not deemed to have an indefinite life, are amortized over their estimated lives, typically ranging from 10 to 15 years, and assessed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events in accordance with applicable accounting literature. The Company had no indefinite lived identified intangible assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Capitalized Software Costs: The Company capitalizes certain costs to develop, purchase or modify software for the internal use of the Company. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Costs related to updates and enhancements are only capitalized if they will result in additional functionality. Capitalized computer software costs of $481 million and $496 million, net of accumulated amortization of $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Legal and Other Loss Contingencies: The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (\"E&O\"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by Oliver Wyman, a subsidiary of the Company, and other methods to estimate potential losses, including estimated legal costs. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period. As of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s liability for errors and omissions was $639 million, compared to $484 million at December 31, 2019, of which $271 million and $149 million, respectively, were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company\u2019s various insurance programs. The legal and other contingent liabilities described above are not discounted. Income Taxes: The Company's effective tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax provision and in evaluating uncertain tax positions and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Tax law may require items be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the income tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Integration and Restructuring Charges: Severance and related costs are recognized based on amounts due under established severance plans or estimates of one-time benefits that will be provided. Typically, severance benefits are recognized when the impacted colleagues are notified of their expected termination and such termination is expected to occur within the legally required notification period. These costs are included in compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of income. Costs for real estate consolidation are recognized based on the type of cost, and the expected future use of the facility. For locations where the Company does not expect to sub-lease the property, the amortization of any right-of-use asset is accelerated from the decision date to the cease use date. For locations where the Company expects to sub-lease the properties subsequent to its vacating the property, the right-of-use asset is reviewed for potential impairment at the earlier of the cease use date or the date a sub-lease is signed. To determine the amount of impairment, the fair value of the right-of-use asset is determined based on the present value of the estimated net cash flows related to the property. Contractual costs outside of the right-of-use asset are recognized based on the net present value of expected future cash outflows for which the Company will not receive any benefit. Such amounts are reliant on estimates of future sub-lease income to be received and future contractual costs to be incurred. These costs are included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Other costs related to integration and restructuring, such as moving, legal or consulting costs are recognized as incurred. These costs are included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Derivative Instruments: All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. The fair value of the derivative is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in other receivables or accounts payable and accrued liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. If a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge, the change in fair value is recorded in earnings. Concentrations of Credit Risk: Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, commissions and fees receivable and insurance recoverables. The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places its investments in a large number of high quality financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas. Per Share Data: Basic net income per share attributable to the Company is calculated by dividing the after-tax income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Diluted net income per share attributable to the Company is calculated by dividing the after-tax income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, which have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares. Basic and Diluted EPS Calculation (In millions, except per share figures) 2020 2019 2018 Net income before non-controlling interests $ 2,046 $ 1,773 $ 1,670 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 30 31 20 Net income attributable to the Company $ 2,016 $ 1,742 $ 1,650 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 506 506 506 Dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares 6 5 5 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 512 511 511 Average stock price used to calculate common stock equivalents $ 109.12 $ 97.23 $ 83.13 Fiduciary Assets and Liabilities: In its capacity as an insurance broker or agent, generally the Company collects premiums from insureds and after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. The Company also collects claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims proceeds are held by the Company in a fiduciary capacity. Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes interest on fiduciary funds of $46 million, $105 million and $65 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Consulting segment recorded fiduciary interest income of $1 million, $4 million and $3 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Since fiduciary assets are not available for corporate use, they are shown in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables were $11.2 billion and $8.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company is not a principal to the contracts under which the right to receive premiums or the right to receive reimbursement of insured losses arises. Accordingly, net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables are not assets and liabilities of the Company and are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In certain instances, the Company advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to collection. These advances are made from corporate funds and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as receivables. Mercer manages assets in trusts or funds for which Mercer\u2019s management or trustee fee is not considered a variable interest, since the fees are commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. Mercer is not the primary beneficiary of these trusts or funds. Mercer\u2019s maximum exposure to loss of its interests is, therefore, limited to collection of its fees. Estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, judgments and methodologies. The estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable. Such matters include: \u2022 the allowance for current expected credit losses on receivables, \u2022 estimates of revenue, \u2022 impairment assessments and charges, \u2022 recoverability of long-lived assets, \u2022 liabilities for errors and omissions, \u2022 deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions and income tax expense, \u2022 share-based and incentive compensation expense, \u2022 useful lives assigned to long-lived assets, and depreciation and amortization, \u2022 fair value estimates of contingent consideration receivable or payable related to acquisitions or dispositions The Company believes these estimates are reasonable based on information currently available at the time they are made. In most situations where estimates, fair values or recoverability of assets is dependent upon short or long term projections of cash flows, revenues or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), the Company has based its projections assuming the gradual lifting of global lockdowns during 2021. The Company has also considered potential impacts to its customer base in various industries and geographies. The ultimate extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat it, and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international customers and markets. Actual results may differ from these estimates. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted Effective January 1, 2021 In January 2020, the FASB issued guidance that addresses accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method and measuring certain purchased options and forward contract to acquire investments. The standard takes effect for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial position or its results of operations. In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance related to the accounting for income taxes. The standard removes specific exceptions in the current rules and eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: (a) exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation; (b) exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments and (c) exception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The standard also is designed to improve financial statement preparers\u2019 application of income tax-related guidance and simplify GAAP for (a) franchise taxes that are partially based on income; (b) transactions with a government that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill; (c) separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax and (d) enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. The standard takes effect for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial position or its results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted Effective January 1, 2020: In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance that amends required fair value measurement disclosures. The guidance adds new requirements, eliminates some current disclosures and modifies other required disclosures. The new disclosure requirements, along with modifications made to disclosures as a result of the change in requirements for narrative descriptions of measurement uncertainty, must be applied on a prospective basis. The effects of all other amendments included in the guidance must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The adoption of this guidance impacted disclosures only and did not have an impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance that amends disclosures related to Defined Benefit Plans. The guidance removes disclosures that no longer are considered cost-beneficial, clarifies the specific requirements of certain disclosures, and adds disclosure requirements identified as relevant. The guidance must be applied on a retrospective basis. Adoption of this guidance impacted disclosures only and did not have an impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the test for goodwill impairment. The new guidance eliminates the second step in the current two-step goodwill impairment process, under which a goodwill impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill for that reporting unit. The new guidance requires a one-step impairment test, in which the goodwill impairment charge is based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The guidance should be applied on a prospective basis with the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle disclosed upon transition. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. The new guidance adds an allowance for credit losses (\"CECL\") impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of lifetime expected credit losses, which the FASB believes will result in more timely recognition of such losses. The new standard is also intended to reduce the complexity of U.S. GAAP by decreasing the number of credit impairment models that entities use to account for debt instruments. Further, the new standard makes targeted changes to the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2019: The following new accounting standard was adopted using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019: Leases Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted new guidance intended to improve financial reporting for leases. Under the new guidance, a lessee is required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases. Consistent with legacy GAAP, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will depend on the classification of the lease as financing or operating. However, unlike legacy GAAP, which requires that only capital leases are recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance requires that both operating and financing leases be recognized on the balance sheet. The Company adopted this new standard using a modified retrospective method, applying the new guidance as of the beginning of the year of adoption, with a cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings at January 1, 2019. Therefore, prior period information has not been restated. The Company has elected the package of practical expedients, which among other things, allows historical lease classifications to be carried forward. The Company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient in determining lease term and impairment of an entity's Right of Use Assets (\"ROU assets\"). On January 1, 2019, the Company recognized a lease liability of $1.9 billion and ROU asset of $1.7 billion, related to real estate operating leases. The ROU asset also reflected reclassification adjustments primarily from other liabilities related to existing deferred rent, unamortized lease incentives and restructuring liabilities of approximately $200 million upon adoption. There was no cumulative-effect adjustment required to be booked to retained earnings upon transition. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our income statement as compared to prior periods. The following new accounting standards were adopted prospectively as of January 1, 2019: Derivatives and Hedging Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted new guidance intended to refine and expand hedge accounting for both financial and commodity risks. The guidance creates more transparency around how economic results are presented in both the financial statements and the footnotes, as well as making targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": {"Debt": ["Debt The Company\u2019s outstanding debt is as follows: December 31, (In millions) 2020 2019 Short-term: Current portion of long-term debt $ 517 $ 1,215 517 1,215 Long-term: Senior notes \u2013 2.35% due 2020 \u2014 500 Senior notes \u2013 3.50% due 2020 \u2014 698 Senior notes \u2013 4.80% due 2021 500 499 Senior notes \u2013 Floating rate due 2021 \u2014 298 Senior notes \u2013 2.75% due 2022 499 498 Senior notes \u2013 3.30% due 2023 349 349 Senior notes \u2013 4.05% due 2023 249 249 Senior notes \u2013 3.50% due 2024 598 597 Senior notes \u2013 3.875% due 2024 995 994 Senior notes \u2013 3.50% due 2025 498 497 Senior notes \u2013 1.349% due 2026 677 609 Senior notes \u2013 3.75% due 2026 597 597 Senior notes \u2013 4.375% due 2029 1,499 1,499 Senior notes \u2013 1.979% due 2030 664 607 Senior notes \u2013 2.25% due 2030 737 \u2014 Senior notes \u2013 5.875% due 2033 298 298 Senior notes \u2013 4.75% due 2039 495 494 Senior notes \u2013 4.35% due 2047 493 492 Senior notes \u2013 4.20% due 2048 592 592 Senior notes \u2013 4.90% due 2049 1,237 1,237 Mortgage \u2013 5.70% due 2035 331 345 Other 5 7 11,313 11,956 Less current portion 517 1,215 $ 10,796 $ 10,741 The senior notes in the table above are registered by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and are not guaranteed. The Company has established a short-term debt financing program of up to $1.5 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. The proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper are used for general corporate purposes. The Company had no com mercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2020. Senior Notes In December 2020, the Company repaid $700 million of maturing Senior Notes. The Company also prepaid $300 million of floating rate notes with an original maturity of December 2021. In May 2020, the Company issued $750 million of 2.250% Senior Notes due 2030. The Company used the net proceeds from this offering to pay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility discussed above. In March 2020, the Company repaid $500 million of maturing Senior Notes. In September 2019, the Company repaid $300 million of maturing senior notes. During 2019, the Company issued approximately $6.5 billion of Senior Notes to primarily fund the acquisition of JLT, including the payment of related fees and expenses, and to repay certain JLT indebtedness, as well as for general corporate purposes. In connection with the closing of the JLT Transaction, the Company assumed approximately $1 billion of historical JLT indebtedness, which it repaid during 2019. The Company incurred debt extinguishment costs of $32 million in regard to the repayment of this debt. Other Credit Facilities In January 2020, the Company closed on $500 million one-year and $500 million two-year term loan facilities. In the first quarter of 2020 the Company borrowed $1 billion against these facilities. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company repaid $500 million of borrowings from its one-year facility. In December 2020, the Company repaid $500 million of borrowings from the two year facility. These two facilities were terminated as of December 31, 2020 after repayment of the initial draw down. In October 2018, the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries increased its multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility expires in October 2023 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowin gs outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2020. The facility includes a provision for determining a LIBOR successor rate in the event LIBOR reference rates are no longer available. In such case, the rate would be determined using an alternate reference rate that has been broadly accepted by the syndicated loan market in the United States in lieu of LIBOR (the \u201cLIBOR successor rate\u201d). If no LIBOR successor rate has been determined, the rate will be based on the higher of the rate announced publicly by Citibank, New York, NY, as its base rate or the fed funds rate plus a fixed margin. In April 2020, the Company entered into a new 364 day $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a term out option after one year. The facility has similar coverage and leverage ratios as the multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2020. Additional credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit are maintained with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $573 million at December 31, 2020 and $598 million at December 31, 2019. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Scheduled repayments of long-term debt in 2021 and in the four succeeding years are $517 million, $516 million, $619 million, $1.6 billion and $518 million, respectively.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 17, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nLiability for Errors and Omissions \u2014 Refer to Notes 1 and 16 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company is subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Such claims and lawsuits consist principally of alleged errors and omissions (\u201cE&O\u201d) in connection with the performance of professional services. These claims may seek damages, including punitive and treble damages, in amounts that could be significant. The Company uses case level reviews performed by inside and outside counsel, internal actuarial analysis and other methods to estimate potential losses resulting from reported and unreported claims. \n\nGiven that the determination of the liability for E&O requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in projecting ultimate settlement values of reported and unreported claims, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of such estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the determination of the liability for E&O included the following, among others: \n\n\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of internal controls related to the determination of the liability for E&O, including controls over the projection of ultimate settlement values of reported and unreported claims determined through internal actuarial analyses, management\u2019s review of the appropriateness of the assumptions used and calculation of case loss estimates, and management\u2019s independent review of case level estimates provided by inside and outside counsel, as applicable. \n\n\u2022 For selected E&O matters, we evaluated the reasonableness of management\u2019s case loss estimates and, as applicable, made inquiries of the Company\u2019s inside and outside counsel regarding the status of these matters and likelihood of settlement. \n\n\u2022 We compared total incurred losses and current case estimates as of the balance sheet date to amounts reported in prior periods to evaluate trends and developments in reported cases. \n\n\u2022 With the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the assumptions and methodologies involved in the development of the liability for E&O by: \n\n\u2013 Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, including historical claims and case loss estimates, to evaluate whether the inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable. \n\n\u2013 Comparing management\u2019s prior-year assumptions of expected development and ultimate loss to actual amounts incurred during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the liability for E&O. \n\n\u2013 Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the liability for E&O recorded by the Company. \n\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP \n\nNew York, New York \n\nFebruary 17, 2021 \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1989. \n\nMarsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nSELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA AND \n\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) \n\n First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter (In millions, except per share figures) 2020: Revenue $ 4,651 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/62709/000006270921000008/mmc-20201231.htm"}, "2019": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations: Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (the \"Company\"), a global professional services firm, is organized based on the different services that it offers. Under this structure, the Company\u2019s two business segments are Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. The Risk and Insurance Services segment provides risk management solutions, services, advice and insurance broking, reinsurance broking and insurance program management services for businesses, public entities, insurance companies, associations, professional services organizations, and private clients. The Company conducts business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter. The Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, wealth and career consulting services and products. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services. On April 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition (the \"Transaction\") of all of the outstanding shares of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc (\"JLT\"), a public company organized under the laws of England and Wales. JLT's results of operations for the period April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 are included in the Company\u2019s results of operations for 2019. JLT's results of operations for the period January 1 through March 31, 2019 and for the years ended 2018 and 2017 are not included in the Company's results of operations and therefore, affect comparability. Prior to being acquired by the Company, JLT operated in three segments: Specialty, Reinsurance and Employee Benefits. JLT operated in 41 countries, with significant revenue in the United Kingdom, Pacific, Asia and the United States. As of April 1, 2019, the historical JLT businesses were combined into MMC operations as follows: JLT Specialty is included by geography within Marsh, JLT Reinsurance is included in Guy Carpenter and the majority of JLT's Employee Benefits business is included in Mercer Health and Wealth. Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Fiduciary Assets and Liabilities: In its capacity as an insurance broker or agent, generally the Company collects premiums from insureds and after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. The Company also collects claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims proceeds are held by the Company in a fiduciary capacity. Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes interest on fiduciary funds of $105 million , $65 million and $39 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The Consulting segment recorded fiduciary interest income of $4 million , $3 million and $4 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Since fiduciary assets are not available for corporate use, they are shown in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables were $8.9 billion and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The increase reflects the inclusion of JLT's balances at December 31, 2019. The Company is not a principal to the contracts under which the right to receive premiums or the right to receive reimbursement of insured losses arises. Accordingly, net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables are not assets and liabilities of the Company and are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In certain instances, the Company advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to collection. These advances are made from corporate funds and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as receivables. Mercer manages assets in trusts or funds for which Mercer\u2019s management or trustee fee is not considered a variable interest, since the fees are commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. Mercer is not the primary beneficiary of these trusts or funds. Mercer\u2019s maximum exposure to loss of its interests is, therefore, limited to collection of its fees. Revenue: The Company provides detailed discussion regarding its revenue policies in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of certificates of deposit and time deposits, with original maturities of three months or less, and money market funds. The estimated fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value. The Company is required to maintain operating funds primarily related to regulatory requirements outside the United States or as collateral under captive insurance arrangements. At December 31, 2019 , the Company maintained $197 million related to these regulatory requirements. Fixed Assets: Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized. Upon sale or retirement of an asset, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of buildings, building improvements, furniture, and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets. Furniture and equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from three to ten years . Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods covered by the applicable leases or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is less. Buildings are depreciated over periods ranging from thirty to forty years . The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. The components of fixed assets are as follows: December 31, (In millions of dollars) 2019 2018 Furniture and equipment $ 1,268 $ 1,159 Land and buildings 377 377 Leasehold and building improvements 1,214 1,007 2,859 2,543 Less-accumulated depreciation and amortization (2,001 ) (1,842 ) $ 858 $ 701 Investments: The caption \"Investment income (loss)\" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments recognized in earnings. It includes, when applicable, other than temporary declines in the value of securities, mark-to-market increases or decreases in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity method gains or losses on the Company's investments in private equity funds. The Company holds investments in certain private equity funds. Investments in private equity funds are accounted for under the equity method of accounting using a consistently applied three-month lag period adjusted for any known significant changes from the lag period to the reporting date of the Company. The underlying private equity funds follow investment company accounting, where investments within the fund are carried at fair value. Investment gains or losses for its proportionate share of the change in fair value of the funds are recorded in earnings. Investments using the equity method of accounting are included in \"other assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets. In 2019 , the Company recorded investment income of $22 million compared to investment loss of $12 million in 2018 and investment income of $15 million in 2017. The investment gain in 2019 includes gains of $10 million related to mark-to-market changes in equity securities and gains of $ 12 million related to investments in private equity funds and other investments. The investment loss in 2018 includes an impairment charge of $ 83 million related to its investment in Alexander Forbes (see Note 10). The net investment loss in 2018 also includes gains of $ 54 million related to mark-to-market changes in equity securities and gains of $ 17 million related to investments in private equity funds and other investments. The investment income in 2017 was due to a gain on the sale of an equity investment and gains related to investments in private equity funds. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. The Company performs an annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a company can assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a goodwill impairment test. Alternatively, the company may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. When a quantitative test is performed, fair values of the reporting units are estimated using either a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter-end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. As discussed in Note 6, the Company elected to perform a quantitative impairment assessment during 2019. Other intangible assets, which primarily consist of acquired customer lists, that are not deemed to have an indefinite life, are amortized over their estimated lives, typically ranging from 10 to 15 years, and reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events in accordance with applicable accounting literature. The Company had no indefinite lived identified intangible assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Capitalized Software Costs: The Company capitalizes certain costs to develop, purchase or modify software for the internal use of the Company. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Costs related to updates and enhancements are only capitalized if they will result in additional functionality. Capitalized computer software costs of $496 million and $435 million , net of accumulated amortization of $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Legal and Other Loss Contingencies: The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (\"E&O\"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by Oliver Wyman Group, a subsidiary of the Company, and other methods to estimate potential losses, including estimated legal costs. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period. In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company\u2019s various insurance programs. The legal and other contingent liabilities described above are not discounted. Income Taxes: The Company's effective tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax provision and in evaluating uncertain tax positions and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. See Part II, Item 7. (\"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" - Income Taxes) for a discussion of accounting policies governing the Company\u2019s income tax provision. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Tax law may require items be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the income tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Integration and Restructuring Charges: Severance and related costs are recognized based on amounts due under established severance plans or estimates of one-time benefits that will be provided. Typically, severance benefits are recognized when the impacted colleagues are notified of their expected termination and such termination is expected to occur within the legally required notification period. These costs are included in compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of income. Costs for real estate consolidation are recognized based on the type of cost, and the expected future use of the facility. For locations where the Company does not expect to sub-lease the property, the amortization of any right-of-use asset is accelerated from the decision date to the cease use date. For locations where the Company expects to sub-lease the properties subsequent to its vacating the property, the right-of-use asset is reviewed for potential impairment at the earlier of the cease use date or the date a sub-lease is signed. To determine the amount of impairment, the fair value of the right-of-use asset is determined based on the present value of the estimated net cash flows related to the property. Contractual costs outside of the right-of-use asset are recognized based on the net present value of expected future cash outflows for which the Company will not receive any benefit. Such amounts are reliant on estimates of future sub-lease income to be received and future contractual costs to be incurred. These costs are included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Other costs related to integration and restructuring, such as moving, legal or consulting costs are recognized as incurred. These costs are included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Derivative Instruments: All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. The fair value of the derivative is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in other receivables or accounts payable and accrued liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. If a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge, the change in fair value is recorded in earnings. Concentrations of Credit Risk: Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, commissions and fees receivable and insurance recoverables. The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places its investments in a large number of high quality financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas. Per Share Data: Basic net income per share attributable to the Company and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the respective after-tax income attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Diluted net income per share attributable to the Company and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the respective after-tax income attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, which have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares. Reconciliations of the applicable components used to calculate basic and diluted EPS - Continuing Operations are presented below.

Actual results may vary from those estimates. New Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2019: The following new accounting standard was adopted using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019: Leases Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted new guidance intended to improve financial reporting for leases. Under the new guidance, a lessee is required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases. Consistent with legacy GAAP, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will depend on the classification of the lease as financing or operating. However, unlike legacy GAAP, which requires that only capital leases are recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance requires that both operating and financing leases be recognized on the balance sheet. The Company adopted this new standard using a modified retrospective method, applying the new guidance as of the beginning of the year of adoption, with a cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings at January 1, 2019. Therefore, prior period information has not been restated. The Company has elected the package of practical expedients, which among other things, allows historical lease classifications to be carried forward. The Company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient in determining lease term and impairment of an entity's Right of Use Assets (\"ROU assets\"). On January 1, 2019, the Company recognized a lease liability of $ 1.9 billion and ROU asset of $ 1.7 billion , related to real estate operating leases. The ROU asset also reflected reclassification adjustments primarily from other liabilities related to existing deferred rent, unamortized lease incentives and restructuring liabilities of approximately $200 million upon adoption. There was no cumulative-effect adjustment required to be booked to retained earnings upon transition. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our income statement as compared to prior periods. The following new accounting standards were adopted prospectively as of January 1, 2019: Derivatives and Hedging Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted new guidance intended to refine and expand hedge accounting for both financial and commodity risks. The guidance creates more transparency around how economic results are presented in both the financial statements and the footnotes, as well as making targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted new guidance that allowed an entity to reclassify the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Job Act (the \"TCJA\") from accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") to retained earnings. The guidance is effective for the period beginning January 1, 2019. The Company elected not to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. The adoption of this standard had no impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. The Company\u2019s accounting policy related to releasing income tax effects from AOCI follows the portfolio approach. New Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2018: The following new accounting standards were adopted using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018: Revenue Recognition Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new accounting guidance related to revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method, which applies the new guidance beginning with the year of adoption, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings at January 1, 2018. The Company elected to apply the modified retrospective method to all contracts. The cumulative effect of adopting the standard, net of tax, on January 1, 2018 resulted in an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings of $364 million , with offsetting increases/decreases to other balance sheet accounts (accounts receivable, other assets and deferred income taxes). Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new guidance intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance requires investments in equity securities (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; and requires a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as \"own credit\") when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. The Company holds certain equity investments that under legacy GAAP were previously treated as available for sale securities, whereby the mark-to-market change was recorded to AOCI in its consolidated balance sheet. The Company adopted the new accounting guidance, effective January 1, 2018, and recorded a cumulative- effect adjustment increase to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption of $14 million , reflecting the reclassification of cumulative unrealized gains, net of tax as of December 31, 2017 from AOCI to retained earnings. Income Tax Consequences of Intra-Entity Transfers Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new guidance which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The new guidance eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. The new guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The new guidance was applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2018, and recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment decrease to retained earnings of approximately $14 million as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Adoption of amended accounting standard using the retrospective application approach Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new guidance that changes the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement cost (''net periodic benefit costs\"). The new guidance requires employers to report the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs in the same line item as other compensation costs in the income statement. The other components of net periodic benefit costs are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The new guidance required retrospective application for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic benefit costs. Accordingly, the Company reclassified prior period information in the consolidated results of operations, segment data and related disclosures contained in our notes to the consolidated financial statements to reflect the retrospective adoption of this standard. New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued guidance related to the accounting for income taxes. The standard removes specific exceptions in the current rules and eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: (a) exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation; (b) exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments and (c) exception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The standard also is designed to improve financial statement preparers\u2019 application of income tax-related guidance and simplify GAAP for (a) franchise taxes that are partially based on income; (b) transactions with a government that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill; (c) separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax and (d) enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. The standard takes effect for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on the Company\u2019s financial position. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance that amends required fair value measurement disclosures. The guidance adds new requirements, eliminates some current disclosures and modifies other required disclosures. The new disclosure requirements, along with modifications made to disclosures as a result of the change in requirements for narrative descriptions of measurement uncertainty, must be applied on a prospective basis. The effects of all other amendments included in the guidance must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this guidance will impact disclosures only and will not have an impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance that amends disclosures related to Defined Benefit Plans. The guidance removes disclosures that no longer are considered cost-beneficial, clarifies the specific requirements of certain disclosures, and adds disclosure requirements identified as relevant. The guidance must be applied on a retrospective basis. The guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this guidance will impact disclosures only and will not have an impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

The Company has established a short-term debt financing program of up to $1.5 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. The proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper are used for general corporate purposes. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2019. Bridge Loan Financing On September 18, 2018, the Company entered into a bridge loan agreement to finance the JLT acquisition. The bridge loan agreement provided for commitments in the aggregate principal amount of \u00a35.2 billion . In 2018, the Company paid approximately $ 35 million of customary upfront fees related to the bridge loan at the inception of the loan commitment, of which $ 30 million was amortized in 2018 and $5 million in the first quarter of 2019 as interest expense. The Company terminated its bridge loan agreement on April 1, 2019. Senior Notes In January 2020, the Company closed on $500 million one-year and $500 million two-year term loan facilities. The interest rate on these facilities is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. The facilities require the Company to maintain coverage ratios and leverage ratios consistent with the revolving credit facility discussed below. The Company has no current borrowings outstanding under these facilities. The facility includes a provision for determining a LIBOR successor rate in the event LIBOR reference rates are no longer available, which is expected to occur by the end of 2021.These facilities are expected to expire on or around the time that LIBOR is expected to be replaced by a successor rate. In September 2019, the Company repaid $300 million of maturing senior notes. In connection with the closing of the JLT Transaction, the Company assumed approximately $ 1 billion of historical JLT indebtedness. In April and June of 2019, the Company repaid approximately $450 million and $553 million , respectively, representing all of JLT's debt it acquired upon the closing of the JLT Transaction. The Company incurred debt extinguishment costs of $ 32 million due to the debt repayments. In March 2019, the Company closed on $300 million one-year and $300 million three-year term loan facilities. The interest rate on these facilities was based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. In August 2019, the Company terminated the $300 million three-year term facility. The Company had $300 million of borrowings outstanding under the one-year term facility at September 30, 2019 , which was repaid and terminated in December 2019. Also in March 2019, the Company issued \u20ac550 million of 1.349% Senior Notes due 2026 and \u20ac550 million of 1.979% Senior Notes due 2030 . In addition, in March 2019, the Company issued an additional $ 250 million of 4.375% Senior Notes due 2029. These notes constitute a further issuance of the 4.375% Senior Notes due 2029, of which $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount was issued in January 2019 (see above). After giving effect to the issuance of the notes, the Company has $ 1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due 2029. The Company used part of the net proceeds from these offerings, along with the $ 5 billion of Senior Notes issued in January 2019 (discussed above) primarily to fund the acquisition of JLT, including the payment of related fees and expenses, and to repay certain JLT indebtedness, as well as for general corporate purposes. In January 2019, the Company issued $ 700 million of 3.50% Senior Notes due 2020, $ 1.0 billion of 3.875% Senior Notes due 2024, $ 1.25 billion of 4.375% Senior Notes due 2029, $ 500 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2039, $ 1.25 billion of 4.90% Senior Notes due 2049 and $ 300 million of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2021. The floating rate notes are based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin. These notes are due prior to the date that LIBOR is expected to be replaced by a successor rate. In October 2018 the Company repaid $250 million of maturing senior notes. In March 2018, the Company issued $ 600 million of 4.20% senior notes due 2048. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. Other Credit Facilities In October 2018, the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries increased its multi-currency five-year unsecured revolving credit facility from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion . The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility expires in October 2023 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2019 . The facility includes a provision for determining a LIBOR successor rate in the event LIBOR reference rates are no longer available. In such case, the rate would be determined using an alternate reference rate that has been broadly accepted by the syndicated loan market in the United States in lieu of LIBOR (the \u201cLIBOR successor rate\u201d). If no LIBOR successor rate has been determined, the rate will be based on the higher of the rate announced publicly by Citibank, New York, NY, as its base rate or the fed funds rate plus a fixed margin. Additional credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit are maintained with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $598 million at December 31, 2019 and $594 million at December 31, 2018 . There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . Scheduled repayments of long-term debt in 2020 and in the four succeeding years are $1.2 billion , $815 million , $515 million , $617 million and $1.6 billion , respectively. Fair value of Short-term and Long-term Debt The estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s short-term and long-term debt is provided below. Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition, nor do they indicate the Company\u2019s intent or need to dispose of the financial instrument.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 20, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nLiability for Errors and Omissions - Refer to Notes 1 and 16 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company is subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Such claims and lawsuits consist principally of alleged errors and omissions (\u201cE&O\u201d) in connection with the performance of professional services. These claims may seek damages, including punitive and treble damages, in amounts that could be significant. The Company uses case level reviews performed by inside and outside counsel, internal actuarial analysis and other methods to estimate potential losses resulting from reported and unreported claims. \n\nGiven that the determination of the liability for E&O requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in projecting ultimate settlement values of reported and unreported claims, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of such estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the determination of the liability for E&O included the following, among others: \n\n \u2022 \n\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls related to the determination of the liability for E&O, including controls over the projection of ultimate settlement values of reported and unreported claims determined through internal actuarial analyses and management\u2019s independent review of case level estimates provided by inside and outside counsel, as applicable. \n\n \u2022 \n\nFor selected E&O matters, we made inquiries of the Company\u2019s inside and outside counsel, as applicable, regarding the status of these matters and likelihood of settlement. \n\n \u2022 \n\nWe compared total incurred losses and current case estimates as of the balance sheet date to amounts reported in prior periods to evaluate trends and developments in reported cases. \n\n \u2022 \n\nWith the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the assumptions and methodologies involved in the development of the liability for E&O by: \n\n \u2013 \n\nTesting the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, including historical claims, to evaluate whether the inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable. \n\n \u2013 \n\nComparing management\u2019s prior-year assumptions of expected development and ultimate loss to actual amounts incurred during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the liability for E&O. \n\n \u2013 \n\nDeveloping a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the liability for E&O recorded by the Company. \n\n Other Intangible Assets - Valuation of Customer Relationship Intangible Assets for the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc (\u201cJLT\u201d) Transaction - Refer to Note 5 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company completed the acquisition of JLT for approximately $5.6 billion on April 1, 2019. The Company accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including customer relationship intangible assets of $1,435 million. Management estimated the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets using the income approach, which determines the fair value as the present value of future cash flows over the remaining economic life of the asset. The fair value determination of customer relationship intangible assets involves significant estimates and assumptions related to future cash flows and the selection of the respective discount rates. \n\nGiven that the fair value determination of customer relationship intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the forecasted future cash flows and the selection of discount rates, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our valuation specialists. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the determination of future cash flows and the selection of the discount rates relating to the customer relationship intangible assets included the following, among others: \n\n \u2022 \n\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the assumptions related to the determination of forecasted future cash flows, selection of the discount rates and the valuation methodology used. \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/62709/000006270920000010/mmc1231201910k.htm"}, "2018": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations: Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (the \"Company\"), a global professional services firm, is organized based on the different services that it offers. Under this structure, the Company\u2019s two business segments are Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. The Risk and Insurance Services segment provides risk management solutions, services, advice and insurance broking, reinsurance broking and insurance program management services for businesses, public entities, insurance companies, associations, professional services organizations, and private clients. The Company conducts business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter. The Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, wealth and career consulting services and products. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services. Acquisitions impacting the Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments are discussed in Note 5 below. Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Fiduciary Assets and Liabilities: In its capacity as an insurance broker or agent, generally the Company collects premiums from insureds and after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. The Company also collects claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims proceeds are held by the Company in a fiduciary capacity. Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes interest on fiduciary funds of $65 million , $39 million and $26 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The Consulting segment recorded fiduciary interest income of $3 million , $4 million and $3 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Since fiduciary assets are not available for corporate use, they are shown in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables were $7.3 billion and $6.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The Company is not a principal to the contracts under which the right to receive premiums or the right to receive reimbursement of insured losses arises. Accordingly, net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables are not assets and liabilities of the Company and are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In certain instances, the Company advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to collection. These advances are made from corporate funds and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as receivables. Mercer manages assets in trusts or funds for which Mercer\u2019s management or trustee fee is not considered a variable interest, since the fees are commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. Mercer is not the primary beneficiary of these trusts or funds. Mercer\u2019s maximum exposure to loss of its interests is, therefore, limited to collection of its fees. Revenue: The Company provides detailed discussion regarding its revenue policies in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of certificates of deposit and time deposits, with original maturities of three months or less, and money market funds. The estimated fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value. The Company is required to maintain operating funds primarily related to regulatory requirements outside the United States or as collateral under captive insurance arrangements. At December 31, 2018 , the Company maintained $186 million related to these regulatory requirements. Fixed Assets: Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized. Upon sale or retirement of an asset, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of buildings, building improvements, furniture, and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets. Furniture and equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods covered by the applicable leases or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is less. Buildings are depreciated over periods ranging from thirty to forty years. The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. The components of fixed assets are as follows: December 31, (In millions of dollars) 2018 2017 Furniture and equipment $ 1,159 $ 1,179 Land and buildings 377 385 Leasehold and building improvements 1,007 974 2,543 2,538 Less-accumulated depreciation and amortization (1,842 ) (1,826 ) $ 701 $ 712 Investments: The caption \"Investment (loss) income\" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments recognized in earnings. It includes, when applicable, other than temporary declines in the value of securities, mark-to-market increases or decreases in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity method gains or losses on the Company's investments in private equity funds. The Company holds certain equity investments, that under legacy GAAP, were previously classified as available for sale securities, whereby the mark-to-market change was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in its consolidated balance sheet. As discussed in Note 1, effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new accounting guidance that requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment that increased retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption by $ 14 million , reflecting the reclassification of cumulative unrealized gains, net of tax as of December 31, 2017 from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Prior periods have not been restated. The Company holds investments in certain private equity funds. Investments in private equity funds are accounted for under the equity method of accounting using a consistently applied three-month lag period adjusted for any known significant changes from the lag period to the reporting date of the Company. The underlying private equity funds follow investment company accounting, where investments within the fund are carried at fair value. Investment gains or losses for its proportionate share of the change in fair value of the funds are recorded in earnings. Investments using the equity method of accounting are included in \"other assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets. In 2018 the Company recorded an investment loss of $12 million compared to investment income of $15 million in 2017 and less than $1 million in 2016. The investment loss in 2018 includes an impairment charge of $ 83 million related to its investment in Alexander Forbes (see Note 10). The net investment loss in 2018 also includes gains of $ 54 million related to mark-to-market changes in equity securities and gains of $ 17 million related to investments in private equity funds and other investments. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. The Company performs an annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. When a step 1 test is performed, fair values of the reporting units are estimated using either a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. As discussed in Note 6, the Company may elect to assess qualitative factors to determine if a step 1 test is necessary. Other intangible assets, which primarily consist of acquired customer lists, that are not deemed to have an indefinite life, are amortized over their estimated lives, typically ranging from 10 to 15 years, and reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events in accordance with applicable accounting literature. The Company had no indefinite lived identified intangible assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Capitalized Software Costs: The Company capitalizes certain costs to develop, purchase or modify software for the internal use of the Company. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Costs related to updates and enhancements are only capitalized if they will result in additional functionality. Capitalized computer software costs of $435 million and $488 million , net of accumulated amortization of $1.3 billion for both December 31, 2018 and 2017 , are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Legal and Other Loss Contingencies: The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (\"E&O\"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by Oliver Wyman Group, a subsidiary of the Company, and other methods to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period. In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company\u2019s various insurance programs. The legal and other contingent liabilities described above are not discounted. Income Taxes: The Company's effective tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax provision and in evaluating uncertain tax positions and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not-recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Tax law may require items be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the income tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Derivative Instruments: All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. The fair value of the derivative is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in other receivables or accounts payable and accrued liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. If a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge, the change in fair value is recorded in earnings. Concentrations of Credit Risk: Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, commissions and fees receivable and insurance recoverables. The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places its investments in a large number of high quality financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas. Per Share Data: Basic net income per share attributable to the Company and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the respective after-tax income attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Diluted net income per share attributable to the Company and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the respective after-tax income attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, which have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares. Reconciliations of the applicable components used to calculate basic and diluted EPS - Continuing Operations are presented below. The reconciling items related to the EPS calculation are the same for both basic and diluted EPS. Basic and Diluted EPS Calculation - Continuing Operations (In millions, except per share figures) 2018 2017 2016 Net income from continuing operations $ 1,670 $ 1,510 $ 1,795 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 20 20 27 $ 1,650 $ 1,490 $ 1,768 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 506 513 519 Dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares 5 6 5 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 511 519 524 Average stock price used to calculate common stock equivalents $ 83.13 $ 77.30 $ 63.51 Estimates: GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may vary from those estimates. New Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2018: The following new accounting standards were adopted using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018: New Revenue Recognition Standard In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method, which applies the new guidance beginning with the year of adoption, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings at January 1, 2018. The Company elected to apply the modified retrospective method to all contracts. The guidance includes requirements to estimate variable or contingent consideration to be received, which will result in revenue being recognized earlier than under legacy GAAP. In addition, the guidance requires the capitalization and amortization of certain costs which were expensed as incurred under legacy GAAP. The adoption of this new revenue recognition standard shifted revenue in the Risk and Insurance Services segment among quarters from historical patterns, but did not have a significant year-over-year impact on annual revenue in either segment. Upon adoption of the new revenue standard, the Company recognized significant movement in the quarterly timing of revenue recognized in the Risk and Insurance Services segment. In particular, under the new standard the recognition of revenue for reinsurance broking was accelerated from historical patterns. Estimated revenue from these treaties is recognized largely at the policy effective date at which point control over the services provided by the Company transfers to the client and the client has accepted the services. This resulted in a significant increase in revenue in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Prior to the adoption of this standard, revenue related to most reinsurance placements was recognized on the later of billing or effective date as premiums are determined by the primary insurers and attached to the reinsurance treaties. Typically, this resulted in revenue being recognized over a 12 to 18 month period. Under the new standard, certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract that were previously expensed as incurred have been capitalized. The Company capitalized the incremental costs to obtain contracts primarily related to commissions or sales bonus payments in both segments. These deferred costs are amortized over the expected life of the underlying customer relationships. In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, certain pre-placement costs to fulfill are now deferred and amortized into earnings when revenue from the placement is recognized. These costs were previously expensed as incurred. As such, the recognition of costs shifted among quarters. In Consulting, the Company incurs implementation costs necessary to facilitate the delivery of the contracted services. The Company has concluded that certain additional implementation costs previously expensed under legacy GAAP will be deferred under the new guidance. In addition, the amortization period for these implementation costs will include the initial contract term plus expected renewals. The cumulative effect of adopting the standard, net of tax, on January 1, 2018 resulted in an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings of $364 million , with offsetting increases/decreases to other balance sheet accounts, e.g. accounts receivable, other assets and deferred income taxes. The comparative prior period information was not restated and will continue to be reported under the legacy accounting standards that were in effect for those periods. The impact of adoption of the new revenue standard on the Company's consolidated income statement was as follows (in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 As Reported Revenue Standard Impact Legacy GAAP Revenue $ 14,950 $ 2 $ 14,952 Expense: Compensation and benefits 8,605 17 8,622 Other operating expenses 3,584 \u2014 3,584 Operating expenses 12,189 17 12,206 Operating income 2,761 (15 ) 2,746 Other net benefit credits 215 \u2014 215 Interest income 11 \u2014 11 Interest expense (290 ) \u2014 (290 ) Investment (loss) income (12 ) \u2014 (12 ) Acquisition related derivative contracts (441 ) \u2014 (441 ) Income before income taxes 2,244 (15 ) 2,229 Income tax expense 574 (4 ) 570 Net income before non-controlling interests 1,670 (11 ) 1,659 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 20 \u2014 20 Net income attributable to the Company $ 1,650 $ (11 ) $ 1,639 The impact of adoption of the new revenue standard on the Company's consolidated balance sheet was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2018 As Reported Revenue Standard Impact Legacy GAAP ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,066 $ \u2014 $ 1,066 Net receivables 4,317 (68 ) 4,249 Other current assets 551 (326 ) 225 Total current assets 5,934 (394 ) 5,540 Goodwill and intangible assets 11,036 \u2014 11,036 Fixed assets, net 701 \u2014 701 Pension related assets 1,688 \u2014 1,688 Deferred tax assets 680 107 787 Other assets 1,539 (242 ) 1,297 TOTAL ASSETS $ 21,578 $ (529 ) $ 21,049 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Current liabilities: Short-term debt $ 314 $ \u2014 $ 314 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 2,234 (129 ) 2,105 Accrued compensation and employee benefits 1,778 \u2014 1,778 Acquisition related derivatives 441 \u2014 441 Accrued income taxes 157 \u2014 157 Total current liabilities 4,924 (129 ) 4,795 Fiduciary liabilities 5,001 \u2014 5,001 Less - cash and investments held in a fiduciary capacity (5,001 ) \u2014 (5,001 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Long-term debt 5,510 \u2014 5,510 Pension, post-retirement and post-employment benefits 1,911 \u2014 1,911 Liabilities for errors and omissions 287 \u2014 287 Other liabilities 1,362 (25 ) 1,337 Total equity 7,584 (375 ) 7,209 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY $ 21,578 $ (529 ) $ 21,049 The impact of adoption of the new revenue standard on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flow was as follows (in millions): Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018 As Reported Revenue Standard Impact Legacy GAAP Operating cash flows: Net income before non-controlling interests $ 1,670 $ (11 ) $ 1,659 Adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operations: Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and capitalized software 311 \u2014 311 Amortization of intangible assets 183 \u2014 183 Adjustments and payments related to contingent consideration liability (4 ) \u2014 (4 ) Loss on deconsolidation of entity 11 \u2014 11 Benefit for deferred income taxes (39 ) \u2014 (39 ) Loss on investments 12 \u2014 12 Gain on disposition of assets (48 ) \u2014 (48 ) Change in fair value of acquisition related derivative contracts 441 \u2014 441 Share-based compensation expense 193 \u2014 193 Changes in assets and liabilities: Net receivables (78 ) \u2014 (78 ) Other current assets 26 8 34 Other assets (37 ) 12 (25 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 23 (7 ) 16 Accrued compensation and employee benefits 68 \u2014 68 Accrued income taxes (40 ) \u2014 (40 ) Contributions to pension and other benefit plans in excess of current year expense/credit (291 ) \u2014 (291 ) Other liabilities 9 (2 ) 7 Effect of exchange rate changes 18 \u2014 18 Net cash provided by operations $ 2,428 $ \u2014 $ 2,428 The adoption of the revenue recognition standard did not have an impact on the Company's financing or investing cash flows. Other Standards Adopted Effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance requires investments in equity securities (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; and requires a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as \"own credit\") when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. The new guidance was effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company holds certain equity investments that under legacy GAAP were previously treated as available for sale securities, whereby the mark-to-market change was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in its consolidated balance sheet. The Company adopted the new accounting guidance, effective January 1, 2018, recording a cumulative-effect adjustment increase to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption of $14 million , reflecting the reclassification of cumulative unrealized gains, net of tax as of December 31, 2017 from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Therefore, prior periods have not been restated. In October 2016, the FASB also issued new guidance which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The new guidance eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. The new guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The new guidance must be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2018, recording a cumulative-effect adjustment decrease to retained earnings of approximately $14 million as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The impact on the Company's balance sheet as of January 1, 2018 related to the adoption of the accounting standards using the modified retrospective approach as discussed above is as follows: Adjustments Balance at December 31, 2017 Revenue Recognition Financial Instruments Intra-Entity Transfer Balance at January 1, 2018 Balance Sheet Assets Net Receivables $ 4,133 $ 68 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 4,201 Other Current Assets 224 318 \u2014 \u2014 542 Other Assets 1,430 226 \u2014 \u2014 1,656 Deferred Tax Assets 669 (103 ) \u2014 (14 ) 552 Liabilities Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities 2,083 122 \u2014 \u2014 2,205 Other Liabilities 1,311 23 \u2014 \u2014 1,334 Equity Other Accumulated Comprehensive Income \u2014 \u2014 (14 ) \u2014 (14 ) Retained Earnings $ 13,140 $ 364 $ 14 $ (14 ) $ 13,504 Cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of the revenue recognition standard The cumulative effect adjustment recorded to net receivables and other current assets is primarily related to contingent brokerage revenue and quota share reinsurance brokerage. Under the new guidance, the Company is required to record an estimate of variable or contingent consideration earlier than under the previous rules. Also under the new guidance, revenue related to most reinsurance placements is accelerated versus previous patterns. The cumulative effect adjustments also includes the capitalization of costs to fulfill and costs to obtain that are included in other current assets and other assets, respectively. These costs were previously expensed as incurred. The adjustment to accounts payable and accrued liabilities includes deferred revenue related to the timing of fee revenue recognition for fee based arrangements and certain post placement servicing costs, primarily related to reinsurance brokerage costs that were previously expensed as incurred. Adoption of amended accounting standard using the retrospective application approach Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new guidance that changes the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement cost (''net periodic benefit costs\"). The new guidance requires employers to report the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs in the same line item as other compensation costs in the income statement. The other components of net periodic benefit costs are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The new guidance requires retrospective application for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic benefit costs. Accordingly, we have reclassified prior period information in the consolidated results of operations, segment data and related disclosures contained in our notes to the consolidated financial statements to reflect the retrospective adoption of this standard. Other accounting standards adopted effective January 1, 2018 In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. As a result, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this guidance, which is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, effective January 1, 2018.

The Company has established a short-term debt financing program of up to $1.5 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. The proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper are used for general corporate purposes. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2018. Bridge Loan Financing On September 18, 2018, the Company entered into a bridge loan agreement to finance the pending JLT acquisition. The bridge loan agreement provides for commitments in the aggregate principal amount of \u00a35.2 billion . Under the bridge loan agreement, any loans will mature 364 days from the date of the first borrowing, and the Company will be required to comply with certain covenants including maintaining an interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio within specified levels. The Company paid approximately $ 35 million of customary upfront fees related to the bridge loan at the inception of the loan commitment, of which $ 30 million was amortized as interest expense in 2018 based on the period of time the facility is expected to be in effect (including any loans outstanding). Any borrowings under the bridge loan agreement will accrue interest at an annual rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate for British pounds sterling, plus an applicable margin based on the Company\u2019s debt ratings and also increasing over time while loans are outstanding. The Company will also be required to pay a duration fee in an amount equal to 50 , 75 and 100 basis points on the principal amount of loans, if any, outstanding on the 90 th , 180 th and 270 th day, respectively, after the first borrowing under the facility, as well as an \"unused fee\" accruing on the available but unused commitments at a rate that varies with the Company\u2019s debt ratings. Unused commitments will be reduced, and loans under the bridge loan agreement prepaid, with the proceeds of certain debt or equity issuances or asset sales. There were no borrowings under the bridge loan agreement at December 31, 2018. The commitments under the bridge loan agreement are expected to be reduced, and any loans thereunder refinanced, with long-term financing. As discussed below, in January 2019, the Company issued $5 billion of senior notes which will be used to fund the acquisition of JLT. The commitments under the bridge loan have therefore been reduced by \u00a33.79 billion , due to the issuance of these senior notes. Senior Notes In October 2018 the Company repaid $250 million of maturing senior notes. In March 2018, the Company issued $ 600 million of 4.20% senior notes due 2048. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. In January 2017, the Company issued $500 million of 2.75% senior notes due 2022 and $500 million of 4.35% senior notes due 2047. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a $250 million debt maturity in April 2017. Subsequent Event \u2013 In January 2019, the Company issued $ 700 million of 3.50% Senior Notes due 2020, $ 1.0 billion of 3.875% Senior Notes due 2024, $ 1.25 billion of 4.375% Senior Notes due 2029, $ 500 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2039, $ 1.25 billion of 4.90% Senior Notes due 2049 and $ 300 million of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2021. The Company intends to use the net proceeds to fund, in part, the pending acquisition of JLT, including the payment of related fees and expenses, and to repay certain JLT indebtedness, as well as for general corporate purposes. Other Credit Facilities In October 2018, the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries increased its multi-currency five -year unsecured revolving credit facility from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion . The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility expires in October 2023 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2018 . Additional credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit are maintained with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $594 million at December 31, 2018 and $624 million at December 31, 2017 . There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . Scheduled repayments of long-term debt in 2019 and in the four succeeding years, excluding the debt issued in January, 2019, are $314 million, $517 million, $515 million, $516 million and $616 million, respectively.

Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition, nor do they indicate the Company\u2019s intent or need to dispose of the financial instrument.

(the \"Company\"), a global professional services firm, is organized based on the different services that it offers. Under this structure, the Company\u2019s two business segments are Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. The Risk and Insurance Services segment provides risk management solutions, services, advice and insurance broking, reinsurance broking and insurance program management services for businesses, public entities, insurance companies, associations, professional services organizations, and private clients. The Company conducts business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter. The Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, retirement, talent and investments. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services. Acquisitions impacting the Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments are discussed in Note 4 below. Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Fiduciary Assets and Liabilities: In its capacity as an insurance broker or agent, generally the Company collects premiums from insureds and after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. The Company also collects claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims proceeds are held by the Company in a fiduciary capacity. Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes interest on fiduciary funds of $39 million , $26 million and $21 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Consulting segment recorded fiduciary interest income of $4 million , $3 million and $4 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Since fiduciary assets are not available for corporate use, they are shown in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables were $6.8 billion and $7 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The Company is not a principal to the contracts under which the right to receive premiums or the right to receive reimbursement of insured losses arises. Accordingly, net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables are not assets and liabilities of the Company and are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In certain instances, the Company advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to collection. These advances are made from corporate funds and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as receivables. Mercer manages approximately $227 billion of assets in trusts or funds for which Mercer\u2019s management or trustee fee is not considered a variable interest, since the fees are commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. Mercer is not the primary beneficiary of these trusts or funds. Mercer\u2019s maximum exposure to loss of its interests is, therefore, limited to collection of its fees. Revenue: Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes insurance commissions, fees for services rendered and interest income on certain fiduciary funds. Insurance commissions and fees for risk transfer services generally are recorded as of the effective date of the applicable policies or, in certain cases (primarily in the Company's reinsurance broking operations), as of the effective date or billing date, whichever is later. A reserve for policy cancellation is provided based on historic and current data on cancellations. Consideration for fee arrangements covering multiple insurance placements, the provision of risk management and/or other services is allocated to all deliverables on the basis of the relative selling prices. Fees for non-risk transfer services provided to clients are recognized over the period in which the services are provided, using a proportional performance model. Fees resulting from achievement of certain performance thresholds are recorded when such levels are attained and such fees are not subject to forfeiture. Consulting revenue includes fees paid by clients for advice and services and commissions from insurance companies for the placement of individual and group contracts. Fee revenue for engagements where remuneration is based on time plus out-of-pocket expenses is recognized based on the amount of time consulting professionals expend on the engagement. For fixed fee engagements, revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model. Revenue from insurance commissions not subject to a fee arrangement is recorded over the effective period of the applicable policies. Revenue for asset based fees is recognized on an accrual basis by applying the daily/monthly rate as contractually agreed with the client to the applicable net asset value. On a limited number of engagements, performance fees may also be earned for achieving certain prescribed performance criteria. Such fees are recognized when the performance criteria have been achieved and, when required, agreed to by the client. Reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff in the generation of revenue and sub-advisory fees related to the majority of funds in the investment management business are included in revenue and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of certificates of deposit and time deposits, with original maturities of three months or less, and money market funds. The estimated fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value. The Company is required to maintain operating funds primarily related to regulatory requirements outside the United States or as collateral under captive insurance arrangements. At December 31, 2017 , the Company maintained $187 million related to these regulatory requirements. Fixed Assets: Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized. Upon sale or retirement of an asset, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of buildings, building improvements, furniture, and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets. Furniture and equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods covered by the applicable leases or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is less. Buildings are depreciated over periods ranging from thirty to forty years. The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. The components of fixed assets are as follows: December 31, (In millions of dollars) 2017 2016 Furniture and equipment $ 1,179 $ 1,113 Land and buildings 385 389 Leasehold and building improvements 974 906 2,538 2,408 Less-accumulated depreciation and amortization (1,826 ) (1,683 ) $ 712 $ 725 Investments: The Company holds investments in certain private equity funds. Investments in private equity funds are accounted for under the equity method of accounting using a consistently applied three-month lag period adjusted for any known significant changes from the lag period to the reporting date of the Company. The underlying private equity funds follow investment company accounting, where investments within the fund are carried at fair value. Investment gains or losses for its proportionate share of the change in fair value of the funds are recorded in earnings. Investments using the equity method of accounting are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. In 2017 , the Company recorded investment income of $15 million compared to less than $1 million in 2016 and $38 million in 2015 . The investment income in 2015 was primarily due to general partner carried interest from the Company's investment in Trident III, which was substantially liquidated in 2015. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. The Company performs an annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. When a step 1 test is performed, fair values of the reporting units are estimated using either a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. As discussed in Note 5, the Company may elect to assess qualitative factors to determine if a step 1 test is necessary. Other intangible assets, which primarily consist of acquired customer lists, that are not deemed to have an indefinite life, are amortized over their estimated lives, typically ranging from 10 to 15 years, and reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events in accordance with applicable accounting literature. The Company had no indefinite lived identified intangible assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . Capitalized Software Costs: The Company capitalizes certain costs to develop, purchase or modify software for the internal use of the Company. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Costs related to updates and enhancements are only capitalized if they will result in additional functionality. Capitalized computer software costs of $488 million and $482 million , net of accumulated amortization of $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Legal and Other Loss Contingencies: The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (\"E&O\"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by Oliver Wyman Group, a subsidiary of the Company, and other methods to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period. In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company\u2019s various insurance programs. The legal and other contingent liabilities described above are not discounted. Income Taxes: The Company's effective tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax provision and in evaluating uncertain tax positions and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. Specific considerations related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform are discussed in more detail in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Tax law may require items be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the income tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Derivative Instruments: All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. The fair value of the derivative is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in other receivables or accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The change in the fair value of a derivative is recorded in the consolidated statement of income in other operating expenses. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. Concentrations of Credit Risk: Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, commissions and fees receivable and insurance recoverables. The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places its investments in a large number of high quality financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas. Per Share Data: Basic net income per share attributable to the Company and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the respective after-tax income attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Diluted net income per share attributable to the Company and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the respective after-tax income attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, which have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares. Reconciliations of the applicable components used to calculate basic and diluted EPS - Continuing Operations are presented below. The reconciling items related to the EPS calculation are the same for both basic and diluted EPS. Basic and Diluted EPS Calculation - Continuing Operations (In millions, except per share figures) 2017 2016 2015 Net income from continuing operations $ 1,510 $ 1,795 $ 1,636 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 20 27 37 $ 1,490 $ 1,768 $ 1,599 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 513 519 531 Dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares 6 5 5 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 519 524 536 Average stock price used to calculate common stock equivalents $ 77.30 $ 63.51 $ 56.27 There were 10.2 million , 13.2 million and 14.8 million stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Estimates: GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may vary from those estimates. New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted: In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which changes the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. If a reporting entity satisfies the first characteristic of a primary beneficiary (such that it is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity), the new guidance requires that reporting entity, in determining whether it satisfies the second characteristic of a primary beneficiary, include all of its direct variable interest in a variable interest entity and, on a proportionate basis, its indirect variable interests in a variable interest entity held through related parties, including related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on its financial position, results of operations and statement of cash flows. In April 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance requires that companies record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as an income tax benefit or expense in the income statement and classify excess tax benefits as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this new guidance prospectively, effective January 1, 2017 and prior periods have not been adjusted. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the adoption of this new standard reduced income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income by approximately $79 million . For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded an excess tax benefit of $44 million and $53 million , respectively, as an increase to equity in its consolidated balance sheets, which was reflected as cash provided by financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor\u2019s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The amendments require that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The new guidance is effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The guidance was adopted on January 1, 2017 and did not have an impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In September 2015, the FASB issued new guidance intended to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in business combinations. The guidance requires the acquirer to recognize adjustments to estimated amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined, and to record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the estimated amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date. The guidance also requires additional disclosures required for the amounts recorded in current period earnings arising from such adjustments. The guidance was adopted on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In May 2015, the FASB issued new guidance which removes the requirement to present certain investments for which the practical expedient is used to measure fair value at net asset value within the fair value hierarchy table. Instead, an entity is required to include those investments as a reconciling item so that the total fair value amount of investments in the disclosure is consistent with the fair value investment balance in the consolidated balance sheets. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this new guidance affected footnote disclosure only, and therefore did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In February 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations and securitization structures. The guidance focuses on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. The guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. In January 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that eliminated the concept of extraordinary items. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of the guidance did not materially affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. New Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2018: New Revenue Recognition Pronouncement In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method, which applies the new guidance beginning with the year of adoption, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings at January 1, 2018. The Company elected to apply the modified retrospective method to all contracts. The guidance includes requirements to estimate variable or contingent consideration to be received, which will result in revenue being recognized earlier than under legacy GAAP. In addition, the guidance requires the capitalization and amortization of certain costs which were expensed as incurred under legacy GAAP. As discussed in more detail below, the adoption of this new revenue recognition standard will shift revenue among quarters from historical patterns, but is not expected to have a significant year-over-year impact on annual revenue. In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, there will be significant movement in the quarterly timing of revenue recognition. In particular, under the new standard the recognition of revenue in the Company\u2019s reinsurance broking operations will be accelerated from historical patterns. Prior to the adoption of this standard, revenue related to most reinsurance placements was recognized on the later of billing or effective date as premiums are determined by the primary insurers and attached to the reinsurance treaties. Typically, this resulted in revenue being recognized over a 12 to 24 month period. Under the new guidance, estimated revenue from these treaties will be recognized largely at the policy effective date. In the insurance brokerage operations, revenue from commission based arrangements will continue to be recorded at the policy effective date, while the timing of revenue recognition for certain fee based arrangements will shift among quarters. However, since the vast majority of our fee arrangements involve contracts that cover a single year of services, the Company does not expect there will be a significant change in the amount of revenue recognized in an annual period. In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, certain pre-placement costs will be deferred and amortized into earnings when the revenue from the placement is recognized. These costs were previously expensed as incurred. As such, the Company expects the recognition of costs to shift among quarters. In the Consulting segment, the adoption of the new revenue standard will not have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition in quarterly or annual periods. In its Consulting segment, the Company incurs implementation costs necessary to facilitate the delivery of the contracted services. Although certain implementation costs are deferred under current GAAP, the Company has concluded that certain additional implementation costs currently expensed under legacy GAAP will be deferred under the new guidance. In addition, the amortization period for these implementation costs will be longer under the new guidance as the amortization period will include the initial contract term plus expected renewals. Currently, deferred implementation costs are amortized over the initial contract term. The cumulative effect of adopting the standard, net of tax, on January 1, 2018 are expected to result in an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings of approximately $ 325 million to $ 425 million , with offsetting increases/decreases to other balance sheet accounts, e.g. accounts receivable, other assets and deferred income taxes. The comparative information and prior periods will not be restated and will continue to be reported under the legacy accounting standards that were in effect for those periods. Other Standards Adopted Effective January 1, 2018 In March 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that changes the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement cost (''net periodic benefit costs\"). The new guidance requires employers to report the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs in the same line item as other compensation costs in the income statement. The other components of net periodic benefit costs are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. In addition, only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization, when applicable. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. The new guidance requires retrospective application for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic benefit costs as discussed in more detail below, and prospective application for the capitalization of the service cost component. The adoption of this guidance will impact the line item presentation of the Company's results of operations, and will not change income before taxes, net income or earnings per share. When the Company files its financial statements for 2018, the consolidated statements of income for 2017 and 2016 will include the following reclassification: 2017 2016 Risk and Insurance Services $ 140 $ 172 Consulting 64 65 Corporate (3 ) (4 ) Increase in Compensation and Benefits 201 233 Other Net Periodic Benefit Credit (201 ) (233 ) Net Impact of Reclassification $ \u2014 $ \u2014 In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; and requires a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as \"own credit\") when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments.

The Company has established a short-term debt financing program of up to $1.5 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. The proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper are used for general corporate purposes. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2017. In January 2017, the Company issued $500 million of 2.75% senior notes due 2022 and $500 million of 4.35% senior notes due 2047. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a $250 million debt maturity in April 2017. In March 2016, the Company issued $350 million of 3.30% seven -year senior notes. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries maintain a $1.5 billion multi-currency five -year unsecured revolving credit facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility expires in November 2020 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2017 . Additional credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit are maintained with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $624 million at December 31, 2017 and $376 million at December 31, 2016 . There was $0 million of outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2017 and $1.6 million of outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2016 .

(the \"Company\"), a global professional services firm, is organized based on the different services that it offers. Under this structure, the Company\u2019s two business segments are Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. The Risk and Insurance Services segment provides risk management activities and insurance broking, reinsurance broking and insurance program management services for businesses, public entities, insurance companies, associations, professional services organizations, and private clients. The Company conducts business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter. The Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, retirement, talent and investments. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services. Acquisitions impacting the Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments are discussed in Note 4 below. Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Fiduciary Assets and Liabilities: In its capacity as an insurance broker or agent, the Company generally collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. The Company also collects claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims proceeds are held by the Company in a fiduciary capacity. Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes interest on fiduciary funds of $26 million , $21 million and $24 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The Consulting segment recorded fiduciary interest income of $3 million , $4 million and $6 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Since fiduciary assets are not available for corporate use, they are shown in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables were $7 billion and $6.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Company is not a principal to the contracts under which the right to receive premiums or the right to receive reimbursement of insured losses arises. Accordingly, net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables are not assets and liabilities of the Company and are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In certain instances, the Company advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to collection. These advances are made from corporate funds and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as receivables. Mercer manages approximately $158 billion of assets in trusts or funds for which Mercer\u2019s management or trustee fee is not considered a variable interest, since the fees are commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. Mercer is not the primary beneficiary of these trusts or funds. Mercer\u2019s maximum exposure to loss of its interests is, therefore, limited to collection of its fees. Revenue: Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes insurance commissions, fees for services rendered and interest income on certain fiduciary funds. Insurance commissions and fees for risk transfer services generally are recorded as of the effective date of the applicable policies or, in certain cases (primarily in the Company's reinsurance broking operations), as of the effective date or billing date, whichever is later. A reserve for policy cancellation is provided based on historic and current data on cancellations. Consideration for fee arrangements covering multiple insurance placements, the provision of risk management and/or other services is allocated to all deliverables on the basis of the relative selling prices. Fees for non-risk transfer services provided to clients are recognized over the period in which the services are provided, using a proportional performance model. Fees resulting from achievement of certain performance thresholds are recorded when such levels are attained and such fees are not subject to forfeiture. Consulting revenue includes fees paid by clients for advice and services and commissions from insurance companies for the placement of individual and group contracts. Fee revenue for engagements where remuneration is based on time plus out-of-pocket expenses is recognized based on the amount of time consulting professionals expend on the engagement. For fixed fee engagements, revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model. Revenue from insurance commissions not subject to a fee arrangement is recorded over the effective period of the applicable policies. Revenue for asset based fees is recognized on an accrual basis by applying the daily/monthly rate as contractually agreed with the client to the applicable net asset value. On a limited number of engagements, performance fees may also be earned for achieving certain prescribed performance criteria. Such fees are recognized when the performance criteria have been achieved and, when required, agreed to by the client. Reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff in the generation of revenue and sub-advisory fees related to the majority of funds in the investment management business are included in revenue and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of certificates of deposit and time deposits, with original maturities of three months or less, and money market funds. The estimated fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value. The Company is required to maintain operating funds primarily related to regulatory requirements outside the United States or as collateral under captive insurance arrangements. At December 31, 2016 , the Company maintained $159 million related to these regulatory requirements. Fixed Assets: Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of buildings, building improvements, furniture, and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets. Furniture and equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods covered by the applicable leases or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is less. Buildings are depreciated over periods ranging from thirty to forty years. The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. The components of fixed assets are as follows: December 31, (In millions of dollars) 2016 2015 Furniture and equipment $ 1,113 $ 1,133 Land and buildings 389 396 Leasehold and building improvements 906 865 2,408 2,394 Less-accumulated depreciation and amortization (1,683 ) (1,621 ) $ 725 $ 773 Investments: The Company holds investments in certain private equity funds. Investments in private equity funds are accounted for under the equity method of accounting using a consistently applied three-month lag period adjusted for any known significant changes from the lag period to the reporting date of the Company. The underlying private equity funds follow investment company accounting, where investments within the fund are carried at fair value. Investment gains or losses for its proportionate share of the change in fair value of the funds are recorded in earnings. Investments using the equity method of accounting are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. In 2016 , the Company recorded investment income of less than $1 million compared to $38 million in 2015 and $37 million in 2014 . The investment income in 2015 and 2014 is primarily due to general partner carried interest from the Company's investment in Trident III, which was substantially liquidated in 2015. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. The Company performs an annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. When a step 1 test is performed, fair values of the reporting units are estimated using either a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. As discussed in Note 6, the Company may elect to assess qualitative factors to determine if a step 1 test is necessary. Other intangible assets, which primarily consist of acquired customer lists, that are not deemed to have an indefinite life, are amortized over their estimated lives, typically ranging from 10 to 15 years, and reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events in accordance with applicable accounting literature. The Company had no indefinite lived identified intangible assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Capitalized Software Costs: The Company capitalizes certain costs to develop, purchase or modify software for the internal use of the Company. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Costs related to updates and enhancements are only capitalized if they will result in additional functionality. Capitalized computer software costs of $482 million and $498 million , net of accumulated amortization of $1.1 billion and $958 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Legal and Other Loss Contingencies: The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (\"E&O\"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by Oliver Wyman Group, a subsidiary of the Company, and other analysis to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period. In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company\u2019s various insurance programs. The legal and other contingent liabilities described above are not discounted. Income Taxes: The Company's effective tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax provision and in evaluating uncertain tax positions and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not-recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Tax law may require items be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the income tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Derivative Instruments: All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. The fair value of the derivative is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in other receivables or accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The change in the fair value of a derivative is recorded in the consolidated statement of income in other operating expenses. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. Concentrations of Credit Risk: Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, commissions and fees receivable and insurance recoverable. The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places its investments in a large number of high quality financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas. Per Share Data: Basic net income per share attributable to the Company and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the respective after-tax income attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Diluted net income per share attributable to the Company and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the respective after-tax income attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, which have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares. Reconciliations of the applicable components used to calculate basic and diluted EPS - Continuing Operations are presented below. The reconciling items related to the EPS calculation are the same for both basic and diluted EPS. Basic and Diluted EPS Calculation - Continuing Operations (In millions, except per share figures) 2016 2015 2014 Net income from continuing operations $ 1,795 $ 1,636 $ 1,471 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 27 37 32 $ 1,768 $ 1,599 $ 1,439 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 519 531 545 Dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares 5 5 8 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 524 536 553 Average stock price used to calculate common stock equivalents $ 63.51 $ 56.27 $ 51.15 There were 13.2 million , 14.8 million and 18.0 million stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Estimates: GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may vary from those estimates. New Accounting Pronouncements: In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued new guidance which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. As a result, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statement of cash flows. In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which changes the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. If a reporting entity satisfies the first characteristic of a primary beneficiary (such that it is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity), the new guidance requires that reporting entity, in determining whether it satisfies the second characteristic of a primary beneficiary, to include all of its direct variable interest in a variable interest entity and, on a proportionate basis, its indirect variable interests in a variable interest entity held through related parties, including related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The new guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on its financial position, results of operations and statement of cash flows. In October 2016, the FASB also issued new guidance which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The new guidance eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. The new guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its financial position or results of operations. In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which adds or clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, including cash payments for debt prepayments or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination and distributions received from equity method investees. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented unless retrospective application is impracticable. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption the guidance will have on its statement of cash flows. In April 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period. Based on the Company\u2019s stock price during January and through February 21, 2017, the Company expects the adoption of this standard to reduce the Company\u2019s reported income tax expense and increase its net income and earnings per share in the first quarter of 2017. However, the specific impact will depend on the number of outstanding options exercised (which the Company does not control) and the Company\u2019s stock price on the dates shares vest and options are exercised. In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor\u2019s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The amendments require that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The new guidance is effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application will be permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its financial position or results of operations. In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP, which requires that only capital leases be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance requires that both types of leases be recognized on the balance sheet. The new guidance will require additional disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, and additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The accounting by organizations that own the assets (\"lessor\") leased by the lessee will remain largely unchanged from current GAAP. However, the guidance contains some targeted improvements that are intended to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and with the updated revenue recognition guidance issued in 2014. The new guidance on leases will take effect for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application will be permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the guidance will have on its financial position and results of operations, but expects material \"right to use\" assets and lease liabilities to be recorded on its consolidated balance sheets. In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; and requires a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as \"own credit\") when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. The new guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the guidance on its financial position and results of operations. New Revenue Recognition Pronouncement In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to clarify the principles for revenue recognition. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that principle, the entity should apply the following steps: identify the contract(s) with the customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract(s), determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Entities are permitted to adopt the guidance under one of the following methods: the \"full retrospective\" method, which applies the guidance to each period presented (prior years restated) or the \"modified retrospective\" method in which the guidance is only applied to the year of adoption, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings. The Company will adopt the new guidance effective January 1, 2018. The Company is evaluating the transition method it will use, but currently expects to use the modified retrospective method. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the standard on our Risk and Insurance Services (\"RIS\") segment. Based on the results of our review to date, the Company expects there will be some movement in the timing of revenue recognition between quarterly and annual periods. However, since the vast majority of our brokerage arrangements involve contracts that cover a single year of placements, on a year over year basis, the Company does not believe there will be a significant change to the amount of revenue recognized in an annual period. The Company's initial review and preliminary conclusions for the Consulting segment indicate the impact on the existing pattern of revenue recognition in quarterly or annual periods will be less significant than for RIS. The conclusions will be completed following a final review of customer arrangement legal terms and conditions in certain of our non-U.S. locations. The Company continues to evaluate the extent to which certain costs it incurs that are currently expensed under GAAP must be capitalized as costs to obtain or costs to fulfill customer contracts under guidance issued as part of the revenue recognition update. Any capitalized costs would be amortized on a basis consistent with the transfer of services to which they relate. Such expenses related to Risk and Insurance Services would generally be \"amortized\" over a period of one year or less. In the Consulting segment, certain expenses that are currently deferred may be amortized over a longer period than our current amortization policy, to reflect the amortization over the expected life of the contract including anticipated renewal periods. The Company has not yet quantified the impact of the changes discussed above. New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In September 2015, the FASB issued new guidance intended to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in business combinations. The guidance requires the acquirer to recognize adjustments to estimated amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined, and to record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the estimated amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquis"]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": {"Debt": ["Debt The Company\u2019s outstanding debt is as follows: December 31, (In millions) 2016 2015 Short-term: Commercial paper $ 50 $ \u2014 Current portion of long-term debt 262 12 312 12 Long-term: Senior notes \u2013 2.30% due 2017 250 249 Senior notes \u2013 2.55% due 2018 249 249 Senior notes \u2013 2.35% due 2019 299 298 Senior notes \u2013 2.35% due 2020 497 496 Senior notes \u2013 4.80% due 2021 498 497 Senior notes \u2013 3.30% due 2023 347 \u2014 Senior notes \u2013 4.05% due 2023 248 248 Senior notes \u2013 3.50% due 2024 596 595 Senior notes \u2013 3.50% due 2025 495 495 Senior notes \u2013 3.75% due 2026 596 595 Senior notes \u2013 5.875% due 2033 297 297 Mortgage \u2013 5.70% due 2035 382 393 Other 3 2 4,757 4,414 Less current portion 262 12 $ 4,495 $ 4,402 The senior notes in the table above are registered by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and are not guaranteed. The Company has established a short-term debt financing program of up to $1.5 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. The proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper are used for general corporate purposes. The Company had $ 50 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2016 at an effective interest rate of 1% . In March 2016, the Company issued $350 million of 3.30% seven -year senior notes. In September 2015, the Company issued $600 million of 3.75% 10.5 -year senior notes and in March 2015, the Company issued $500 million of 2.35% five -year senior notes. The Company used the net proceeds from these issuances for general corporate purposes. The Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries maintain a $1.5 billion multi-currency five -year unsecured revolving credit facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility expires in November 2020 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2016 . Additional credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit are maintained with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $376 million at December 31, 2016 and $379 million at December 31, 2015 . There was $1.6 million of outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2016 and $0.4 million of outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2015 . In January 2017, the Company issued $500 million of 2.75% senior notes due 2022 and $ 500 million of 4.35% senior notes due 2047. The Company intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a $ 250 million debt maturity in April 2017.

(the \"Company\u201d), a global professional services firm, is organized based on the different services that it offers. Under this organizational structure, the Company\u2019s two business segments are Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. The Risk and Insurance Services segment provides risk management activities and insurance broking, reinsurance broking and insurance program management services for businesses, public entities, insurance companies, associations, professional services organizations, and private clients. The Company conducts business in this segment through Marsh and Guy Carpenter. The Company conducts business in its Consulting segment through two main business groups. Mercer provides consulting expertise, advice, services and solutions in the areas of health, retirement, talent and investments. Oliver Wyman Group provides specialized management and economic and brand consulting services. Acquisitions impacting the Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments are discussed in Note 4 below. Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Fiduciary Assets and Liabilities: In its capacity as an insurance broker or agent, the Company generally collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. The Company also collects claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims proceeds are held by the Company in a fiduciary capacity. Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes interest on fiduciary funds of $21 million , $24 million and $27 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The Consulting segment recorded fiduciary interest income of $4 million , $6 million and $5 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Since fiduciary assets are not available for corporate use, they are shown in the consolidated balance sheets as an offset to fiduciary liabilities. Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables were $6.9 billion and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The Company is not a principal to the contracts under which the right to receive premiums or the right to receive reimbursement of insured losses arises. Net uncollected premiums and claims and the related payables are, therefore, not assets and liabilities of the Company and are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In certain instances, the Company advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to collection. These advances are made from corporate funds and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as receivables. Mercer manages approximately $21 billion of assets in trusts or funds for which Mercer\u2019s management or trustee fee is considered a variable interest. Mercer is not the primary beneficiary of these trusts or funds. Mercer\u2019s only variable interest in any of these trusts or funds is its unpaid fees, if any. Mercer\u2019s maximum exposure to loss of its interests is, therefore, limited to collection of its fees. Revenue: Risk and Insurance Services revenue includes insurance commissions, fees for services rendered and interest income on certain fiduciary funds. Insurance commissions and fees for risk transfer services generally are recorded as of the effective date of the applicable policies or, in certain cases (primarily in the Company's reinsurance broking operations), as of the effective date or billing date, whichever is later. A reserve for policy cancellation is provided based on historic and current data on cancellations. Consideration for fee arrangements covering multiple insurance placements, the provision of risk management and/or other services are allocated to all deliverables on the basis of their relative selling prices. Fees for non-risk transfer services provided to clients are recognized over the period in which the services are provided, using a proportional performance model. Fees resulting from achievement of certain performance thresholds are recorded when such levels are attained and such fees are not subject to forfeiture. Consulting revenue includes fees paid by clients for advice and services and commissions from insurance companies for the placement of individual and group contracts. Fee revenue for engagements where remuneration is based on time plus out-of-pocket expenses is recognized based on the amount of time consulting professionals expend on the engagement. For fixed fee engagements, revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model. Revenue from insurance commissions not subject to a fee arrangement is recorded over the effective period of the applicable policies. Revenue for asset based fees is recognized on an accrual basis by applying the daily/monthly rate as contractually agreed with the client to the applicable net asset value. On a limited number of engagements, performance fees may also be earned for achieving certain prescribed performance criteria. Such fees are recognized when the performance criteria have been achieved and, when required, agreed to by the client. Reimbursable expenses incurred by professional staff in the generation of revenue and sub-advisory fees related to the majority of funds in the investment management business are included in revenue and the related expenses are included in other operating expenses. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of certificates of deposit and time deposits, with original maturities of three months or less, and money market funds. The estimated fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value. The Company is required to maintain operating funds primarily related to regulatory requirements outside the U.S. or as collateral under captive insurance arrangements. At December 31, 2015 , the Company maintained $209 million related to these regulatory requirements. Fixed Assets: Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of buildings, building improvements, furniture, and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets. Furniture and equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods covered by the applicable leases or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is less. Buildings are depreciated over periods ranging from thirty to forty years. The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. The components of fixed assets are as follows: December 31, (In millions of dollars) 2015 2014 Furniture and equipment $ 1,133 $ 1,193 Land and buildings 396 401 Leasehold and building improvements 865 854 2,394 2,448 Less-accumulated depreciation and amortization (1,621 ) (1,639 ) $ 773 $ 809 Investments: The Company holds investments in private companies and private equity funds. Investments in private equity funds are accounted for under the equity method of accounting using a consistently applied three-month lag period adjusted for any known significant changes from the lag period to the reporting date of the Company. The underlying private equity funds follow investment company accounting, where investments within the fund are carried at fair value. The Company records in earnings, investment gains/losses for its proportionate share of the change in fair value of the funds. Investments using the equity method of accounting are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. As part of the sale of MMC Capital in 2005, the Company retained the rights to receive certain performance fees related to the Trident II and Trident III private equity partnerships. The Company recognizes performance fee income when such fees are no longer subject to forfeiture, which may take a number of years to resolve. This income is based on the investment performance over the life of each investment in the private equity fund, and future declines in the fund performance from current levels may result in forfeiture of such revenue. Since Trident II fully harvested all its portfolio investments and made final distributions to its partners in 2013, the Company no longer holds any rights to Trident II performance fees. In 2015 , the Company recorded investment income of $38 million compared to $37 million in 2014 and $69 million in 2013 . The Company recorded investment income related to its general partner carried interest from Trident III no longer subject to clawback of $29 million , $31 million and $41 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2013, the Company recorded $15 million of general partner carried interest from Trident II. Stonepoint Capital, the investment manager of Trident III, harvested its remaining two investments in Trident III in the third quarter of 2015, which resulted in the Company recognizing its remaining deferred performance fees. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. The Company performs an annual impairment test for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. When a step 1 test is performed, fair values of the reporting units are estimated using either a market approach or a discounted cash flow model. Carrying values for the reporting units are based on balances at the prior quarter end and include directly identified assets and liabilities as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level. As discussed in Note 6, the Company may elect to assess qualitative factors to determine if a step 1 test is necessary. Other intangible assets, which primarily consist of customer lists that are not deemed to have an indefinite life, are amortized over their estimated lives, typically ranging from 10 to 15 years, and reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events in accordance with applicable accounting literature. The Company had no indefinite lived identified intangible assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Capitalized Software Costs: The Company capitalizes certain costs to develop, purchase or modify software for the internal use of the Company. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Costs related to updates and enhancements are only capitalized if they will result in additional functionality. Capitalized computer software costs of $498 million and $501 million , net of accumulated amortization of $958 million and $837 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Legal and Other Loss Contingencies: The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions (\"E&O\"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") requires that a liability be recorded when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Significant management judgment is required to apply this guidance. The Company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis and other analysis to estimate potential losses. The liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. In many cases, the Company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation that could flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow in a given quarterly or annual period. In addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the Company\u2019s various insurance programs. The legal and other contingent liabilities described above are not discounted. Income Taxes: The Company's effective tax rate reflects its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step involves recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Tax law requires items to be included in the Company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the income tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that future taxable income will be insufficient to use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Derivative Instruments: All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. The fair value of the derivative is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in other receivables or accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The change in the fair value of a derivative is recorded in the consolidated statement of income in other operating expenses. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. Concentrations of Credit Risk: Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, commissions and fees receivable and insurance recoverable. The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places its investments in a large number of high quality financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas. Per Share Data: Basic net income per share attributable to the Company and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the respective after-tax income attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Diluted net income per share attributable to the Company and income from continuing operations per share are calculated by dividing the respective after-tax income attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, which have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares. Reconciliations of the applicable income components used for diluted EPS - Continuing Operations and basic weighted average common shares outstanding to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are presented below. The reconciling items related to the calculation of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are the same for net income attributable to the Company. Basic and Diluted EPS Calculation - Continuing Operations (In millions, except per share figures) 2015 2014 2013 Net income from continuing operations $ 1,636 $ 1,471 $ 1,379 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 37 32 28 $ 1,599 $ 1,439 $ 1,351 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 531 545 549 Dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares 5 8 9 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 536 553 558 Average stock price used to calculate common stock equivalents $ 56.27 $ 51.15 $ 40.97 There were 14.8 million , 18.0 million and 22.6 million stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Estimates: GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may vary from those estimates. New Accounting Pronouncements: In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued new guidance intended to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in business combinations. The guidance requires the acquirer to recognize adjustments to estimated amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined, and to record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the estimated amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date. The guidance also includes additional disclosures required for the amounts recorded in current period earnings arising from such adjustments. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance should be applied prospectively for adjustments to provisional amounts after the effective date, with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. In May 2015, the FASB issued new guidance which removes the requirement to present certain investments for which the practical expedient is used to measure fair value at net asset value within the fair value hierarchy table. Instead, an entity would be required to include those investments as a reconciling item so that the total fair value amount of investments in the disclosure is consistent with the fair value investment balance on the statement of net assets. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this new guidance will affect footnote disclosure and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. In February 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations and securitization structures. The guidance focuses on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. The guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. In January 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that eliminated the concept of extraordinary items. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The guidance may be adopted prospectively, or retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Adoption of the guidance is not expected to materially affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to clarify the treatment of share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to be eligible to vest in the awards which include terms that may provide that the performance conditions could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period. The guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such, a reporting entity should apply the existing guidance as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Adoption of the guidance is not expected to materially affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to clarify the principles for revenue recognition. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that principle, the entity should apply the following steps: identify the contract(s) with the customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract(s), determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. Entities are permitted to adopt the guidance under one of the following methods: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (with certain practical expedients allowed) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application. If an entity elects this transition method, it must provide disclosures in reporting periods that include the date of initial application of the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period by application of the guidance as compared to guidance that was in effect before the change, and an explanation for the reasons for significant changes. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the guidance on its financial condition and results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In November 2015, the FASB issued a new standard related to the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes (\"deferred tax standard\"), which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. The deferred tax standard requires companies to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. The previous standard required companies to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent. The deferred tax standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted for any interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. Effective December 31, 2015, the Company early adopted the deferred tax standard retrospectively, as a change in accounting principle. The impact of this change on the Company's prior years Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is shown in the table below. The adoption of this standard had no impact on our results of operations. In April 2015, the FASB issued a new standard related to the presentation of debt issuance costs (\"debt issuance costs standard\"). The debt issuance cost standard requires debt issuance costs related to recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The previous standard required these debt issuance costs be classified as an asset and amortized ratably over the life of the debt. The debt issuance cost standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted for any interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. The Company has elected to early adopt the debt issuance costs standard, effective December 31, 2015. The adoption of the debt issuance costs standard had no impact on our results of operations. This guidance is effective on a retrospective basis, as a change in accounting principle. The impact of this change on the Company's prior years Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is shown in the table below. 2014 Consolidated Balance Sheet As Previously Reported Change in Deferred Tax Presentation Change in Prepaid Debt Fees Presentation As Amended Current deferred tax asset $ 521 $ (521 ) $ \u2014 $ \u2014 Other current assets 199 \u2014 (1 ) 198 Total current assets 6,055 (521 ) (1 ) 5,533 Deferred tax assets 876 482 \u2014 1,358 Other assets 1,200 \u2014 (7 ) 1,193 Total assets 17,840 (39 ) (8 ) 17,793 Accrued income taxes 178 (28 ) \u2014 150 Total current liabilities 3,705 (28 ) \u2014 3,677 Long-term debt 3,376 \u2014 (8 ) 3,368 Other liabilities 1,041 (11 ) \u2014 1,030 Total liabilities and equity $ 17,840 $ (39 ) $ (8 ) $ 17,793 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Changes in assets and liabilities: Other current assets $ (32 ) $ 39 $ 1 $ 8 Other assets 25 (18 ) 6 13 Accrued income taxes 43 (10 ) \u2014 33 Other liabilities (185 ) (11 ) \u2014 (196 ) Net cash provided by operations 2,112 \u2014 7 2,119 Proceeds from debt 1,393 \u2014 (7 ) 1,386 Net cash used for financing activities $ (961 ) $ \u2014 $ (7 ) $ (968 ) 2013 As Previously Reported Change in Deferred Tax Presentation As Amended Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Changes in assets and liabilities: Other current assets $ (70 ) $ 71 $ 1 Other assets (75 ) (66 ) (141 ) Accrued income taxes 43 \u2014 43 Other liabilities 13 (5 ) 8 Net cash provided by operations 1,341 \u2014 1,341 Proceeds from debt 547 \u2014 547 Net cash used for financing activities $ (834 ) $ \u2014 $ (834 ) In April 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and enhances disclosures in this area. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations, such as disposal of a major geographic area or a major line of business, should be presented as discontinued operations. Those strategic shifts should have a major impact on the organization's operations and financial results. In addition, the new guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2014. Adoption of the guidance did not have a material affect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Reclassifications In addition to the above changes, reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform with current year separate presentation of goodwill and other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": {"Debt": ["Debt The Company\u2019s outstanding debt is as follows: December 31, (In millions of dollars) 2015 2014 * Short-term: Current portion of long-term debt $ 12 $ 11 Long-term: Senior notes \u2013 2.30% due 2017 249 249 Senior notes \u2013 2.55% due 2018 249 249 Senior notes \u2013 2.35% due 2019 298 298 Senior notes \u2013 2.35% due 2020 496 \u2014 Senior notes \u2013 4.80% due 2021 497 497 Senior notes \u2013 4.05% due 2023 248 247 Senior notes \u2013 3.50% due 2024 595 594 Senior notes \u2013 3.50% due 2025 495 494 Senior notes \u2013 3.75% due 2026 595 \u2014 Senior notes \u2013 5.875% due 2033 297 297 Mortgage \u2013 5.70% due 2035 393 403 Term Loan Facility \u2014 50 Other 2 1 4,414 3,379 Less current portion 12 11 $ 4,402 $ 3,368 * Amended to reflect the adoption in 2015 of new Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs. The senior notes in the table above are publically registered by the Company with no guarantees attached. In September 2015, the Company issued $600 million of 3.75% 10.5 -year senior notes. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. In March 2015, the Company issued $500 million of 2.35% five -year senior notes. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. In September 2014, the Company issued $300 million of 2.35% five -year senior notes and $500 million of 3.50% 10.5 -year senior notes. In October 2014, a significant portion of the net proceeds of this offering were used to redeem $630 million of debt, including $230 million of 5.75% senior notes due in September 2015 and $400 million of 9.25% senior notes due in 2019. Total cash outflow related to this transaction was approximately $765 million , including a $137 million cost for early redemption, which was reflected as a charge in the consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter of 2014. In May 2014, the Company issued $600 million of 3.50% ten -year senior notes. The net proceeds of this offering were used for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment of $320 million of the existing 5.375% senior notes, which matured on July 15, 2014. On November 24, 2015, the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries amended a $1.2 billion multi-currency five -year revolving credit facility, that was due to expire in March 2019, into a new $1.5 billion multi-currency five -year unsecured revolving credit facility. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin which varies with the Company's credit ratings. This facility expires in November 2020 and requires the Company to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios which are tested quarterly. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2015 . The Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries previously maintained a $1.2 billion multi-currency five -year revolving credit facility. The facility was previously due to expire in March 2019 and was in effect until November 2015. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at the time it was amended. The Company has a $150 million uncommitted bank credit line. There were no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2015 . In December 2012, the Company closed on a $50 million , three -year term loan facility, which was terminated on October 30, 2015. Additional credit facilities, guarantees and letters of credit are maintained with various banks, primarily related to operations located outside the United States, aggregating $229 million at December 31, 2015 and $260 million at December 31, 2014 . There was $0.4 million outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2015 and $0.6 million outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2014 . Scheduled repayments of long-term debt in 2016 and in the four succeeding years are $12 million, $263 million, $262 million, $313 million and $514 million, respectively. Fair value of Short-term and Long-term Debt The estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s short-term and long-term debt is provided below. Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition, nor do they indicate the Company\u2019s intent or need to dispose of the financial instrument.

Fiscal 2022 consisted of 53 weeks, and fiscal 2021 and 2020 each consisted of 52 weeks. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company\u2019s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Reclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or services are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all the Company\u2019s revenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performance obligation. Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company\u2019s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The Company has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers. Non-custom products The Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers, which includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single performance obligation. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events. The Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special pricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer\u2019s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Constraints of variable consideration have not been material. Custom products Custom products which are associated with the Company\u2019s Gaming segment (semi-custom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over the time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the Company\u2019s satisfaction of its performance obligation. Sales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products. Development and intellectual property licensing agreements From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services and a license to the right to use the Company\u2019s IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or multiple performance obligations based upon the nature of the arrangements. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control, over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license is not distinct, it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license. From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no performance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company\u2019s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving either the sale or licensing of IP. Inventories The Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances and non-cancellable purchase orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required . Business Combinations The Company is required to use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The acquisition method of accounting requires the Company to allocate the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquiree based on their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Goodwill The Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. The Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or elects to bypass the qualitative test, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company\u2019s quantitative impairment analysis uses a combination of the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting unit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting units. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of reporting units in the near- and long-term, expectations of the Company\u2019s ability to execute on roadmaps and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows. Significant estimates used in the market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, and the determination of the appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit. If a reporting unit\u2019s fair value is determined to be less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Long-Lived and Intangible Assets Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, the Company estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for credit loss. Accounts receivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on development services recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to customers and semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months. The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the Company may require letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments if deemed necessary. The Company maintains an allowance for credit loss, consisting of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit risk. Investments Available for Sale Debt Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. If an available-for-sale debt security\u2019s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether the decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not attributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. Classification of available-for-sale debt securities as current or non-current is based on the Company\u2019s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months. Non-marketable Securities. The Company\u2019s investments in non-marketable securities of privately-held companies are accounted for under the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. The Company's periodic assessment of impairment is made by considering available evidence, including the investee\u2019s general market and industry conditions and product development status. The Company also assesses the investee\u2019s ability to meet business milestones, its financial condition, and near-term prospects, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee\u2019s need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation and any bona fide offer to purchase the investee. Fair Value Measurements The Company\u2019s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies, which are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative. Fair Value Hierarchy The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. The guidance for fair value measurements requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 \u2014 Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 \u2014 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 \u2014 Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of one to 15 years for equipment, 34 to 44 years for buildings, and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements. Leases Operating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company\u2019s balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the lease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as the Company has centralized treasury operations. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the accounting policy to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. The Company\u2019s finance leases are immaterial. Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions The functional currency of the majority of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. For certain foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Gains or losses arising from translation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities (i.e., cumulative translation adjustment) are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings. Marketing and Advertising Expenses Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company\u2019s marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Total marketing and advertising expenses for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $683 million, $578 million and $314 million, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option\u2019s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes model. For time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of RSUs that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under the Company\u2019s Employee Stock Purchase plan (ESPP) using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to RSUs with performance or market conditions (PRSUs), which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Contingencies From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Income Taxes The Company computes the provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will be realized. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable taxing jurisdictions. In addition, the Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that they will be sustained, based on the technical merits of the positions, on examination by the jurisdictional tax authority. Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). In 2022, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for the United States GILTI tax from recording the tax impact in the period it is incurred to recognizing deferred taxes for temporary tax basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI tax in future years. The change is considered preferable based on the Company\u2019s facts and circumstances as it provides better and more timely information of expected future income tax liabilities arising from temporary tax differences primarily associated with the Xilinx acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded $27.3 billion of identified intangible assets (refer to Note 5 - Business Combinations), of which $16.9 billion are related to foreign operations which will be amortized to income from operations over the assets\u2019 estimated useful lives, but for which the Company will not receive a tax deduction under GILTI. This accounting policy change resulted in the recording of $857 million of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the Xilinx acquisition as disclosed in Note 14 - Income Taxes. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2022, it resulted in a decrease in the income tax provision with a corresponding increase to net income of $296 million and an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.19, as compared to the computation under the previous accounting policy. This accounting policy change had no material impact on the Company\u2019s historical consolidated financial statements. Accrued Interest on Unrecognized Tax Benefits. Prior to 2022, the Company reported any interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of Interest expense and reported any related penalties as a component of Income tax provision (benefit). In 2022, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for tax interest expense from Interest expense to the Income tax provision (benefit) line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This change in classification is considered preferable as it i) better aligns classification of tax interest with the substance of the underlying tax positions, which are managed inclusive of interest, ii) allows for greater visibility to the cost of the Company\u2019s debt and other financing activities, and iii) better aligns with common industry practice and provides increased comparability. This accounting policy change resulted in a decrease in Interest expense and corresponding increase to i) Income before income taxes and equity income and ii) Income tax provision (benefit) as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations of $11 million in 2022. This accounting policy change had an immaterial effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2021 and 2020, and the Company did not revise its previously issued consolidated financial statements for these fiscal years. This accounting policy change had no impact to net income or basic and diluted earnings per share, or to financial statements besides the Consolidated Statements of Operations, for any period, as compared to the computation under the previous accounting policy."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": NaN, "external_audit": null, "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248823000047/amd-20221231.htm"}, "2021": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Fiscal Year . The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 ended on December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively. Fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 each consisted of 52 weeks. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company\u2019s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Reclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation and assessing potential impairment, if any, of goodwill and deferred income taxes. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or services are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all the Company\u2019s revenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performance obligation. Non-custom products The Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers, which includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single performance obligation. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events. The Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special pricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer\u2019s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Constraints of variable consideration have not been material. Custom products Custom products which are associated with the Company\u2019s Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment (semi-custom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over the time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the Company\u2019s satisfaction of its performance obligation. Sales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products. Development and intellectual property licensing agreements From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services and a license to the right to use the Company\u2019s IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or multiple performance obligations based upon the nature of the arrangements. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control, over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license is not distinct, it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license. From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no performance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company\u2019s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving either the sale or licensing of IP. Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company\u2019s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The Company has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers. Inventories The Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances and non-cancellable purchase orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required . Goodwill The Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. The Company first analyzes qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit\u2019s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which a reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Contingencies From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Other investments in time deposits due within 12 months and marketable securities are included in short-term investments. Classification of marketable securities as current is based on the Company\u2019s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for credit loss. Accounts receivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on development services recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to customers and semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months. The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the Company may require letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments if deemed necessary. The Company maintains an allowance for credit loss, consisting of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit risk. Investments in Available-for-sale Debt Securities The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. If an available-for-sale debt security\u2019s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether the decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not attributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives of equipment is two Leases Operating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company\u2019s balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the lease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as the Company has centralized treasury operations. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the accounting policy to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. The Company\u2019s finance leases are immaterial. Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions The functional currency of all of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings. Marketing and Advertising Expenses Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company\u2019s marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Total marketing and advertising expenses for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $578 million , $314 million and $217 million, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option\u2019s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes model. For time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of RSUs that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under the Company\u2019s Employee Stock Purchase plan (ESPP) using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to RSUs with performance or market conditions (PRSUs), which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Income Taxes The Company computes the provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will be realized. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable taxing jurisdictions. In addition, the Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that they will be sustained, based on the technical merits of the positions, on examination by the jurisdictional tax authority. The Company recognizes any accrued interest and penalties to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Income Taxes. In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2019-12, I ncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which simplifies various aspects of accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2021 using the modified retrospective adoption method through a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the period. The adoption of this new standard resulted in the recognition of an $8.4 million deferred tax liability associated with book-tax differences in foreign equity method investments. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements had or will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": NaN, "external_audit": null, "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248822000016/amd-20211225.htm"}, "2020": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Fiscal Year .

Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control, over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license is not distinct it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time.

Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and intellectual property arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving either the sale or licensing of IP. Total revenue recognized over time associated with custom products and development services accounted for approximately 18%, 19% and 29% of the Company\u2019s revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company\u2019s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The Company has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers.

The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy.

If an available-for-sale debt security\u2019s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether the decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not attributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on development services recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to customers and semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers.

The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the Company may require letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments if deemed necessary. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, consisting of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit risk. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows: equipment uses two Leases The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement. When the Company determines the arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at lease inception, it then determines whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating and finance leases result in the Company recording a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability on its balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable or when the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is not a commonly quoted rate and is derived through a combination of inputs including the Company\u2019s credit rating and the impact of full collateralization. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company\u2019s collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the lease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as the Company has centralized treasury operations. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes any lease incentives. Specific lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when the Company believes it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As allowed by the guidance, the Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. The Company\u2019s finance leases are immaterial. Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions The functional currency of all of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings. Marketing and Advertising Expenses Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company\u2019s marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Total marketing and advertising expenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $314 million, $217 million and $176 million, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option\u2019s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes model. For time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of RSUs that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under the Employee Stock Purchase plan (ESPP) using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to RSUs with performance or market conditions (PRSUs), which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Income Taxes The Company computes the provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will be realized. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable taxing jurisdictions. In addition, the Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it expects that its tax positions are more likely than not that they will be sustained, based on the technical merits of the positions, on examination by the jurisdictional tax authority. The Company recognizes any accrued interest and penalties to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments \u2014 Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . This standard changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2020 using the modified retrospective adoption method. This standard did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt \u2014 Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity. This standard simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments and its application of the derivatives scope exception for contracts in its own equity by eliminating some of the models that require separating embedded conversion features from convertible instruments. The guidance also addresses how convertible instruments are accounted for in the diluted earnings per share calculation and enhances disclosures about the terms of convertible instruments and contracts in an entity\u2019s own equity. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted, and can be adopted through either a modified retrospective method with a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings or a full retrospective method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements had or will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": NaN, "external_audit": "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 29, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\n Inventory Valuation \n\nDescription of the Matter At December 26, 2020, the Company\u2019s net inventory balance was $1,399 million. As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company adjusts the inventory carrying value to the lower of actual cost or the estimated net realizable value after completing ongoing reviews of on-hand inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand, by considering recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. Auditing management\u2019s inventory carrying value adjustments involved significant judgment because the estimates are based on a number of factors that are affected by market, industry, and competitive conditions outside the Company's control. In particular, in estimating inventory carrying value adjustments, management developed assumptions such as forecasts of future sales quantities and the selling prices, which are sensitive to the competitiveness of product offerings, customer requirements, and product life cycles. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's inventory carrying value adjustment determination process, including the basis for developing above described assumptions and management\u2019s judgments. Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of management\u2019s key assumptions and judgments and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used to determine the amount of inventory carrying value adjustments. For instance, we compared the quantities and carrying value of on-hand inventories to related unit sales, both historical and forecasted, assessed the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates of future sales prices by analyzing historical sales and evaluating any factors that may impact sales prices, and evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of management\u2019s adjustments to such sales forecasts by analyzing potential technological changes in line with product life cycles and/or identified alternative customer uses. We also assessed the accuracy of forecasts underlying management's estimates by comparing management\u2019s historical forecasts to actual results, evaluated industry and market factors and performed sensitivity analyses over the significant assumptions used by management to evaluate necessary changes in the inventory carrying value adjustments. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 26, 2020, the Company carried deferred tax assets of $1,420 million, net of a $1,576 million valuation allowance. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of all available evidence, in management\u2019s judgment it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Once established, the valuation allowance is released when, based on the weight of all available evidence, management concludes that related deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. In 2020, management concluded sufficient positive evidence exists to release a portion of the valuation allowance related to U.S. deferred tax assets, resulting in an income tax benefit of $1,301 million in 2020. \n\nAuditing management's analysis of the realizability of the deferred tax assets was complex and highly judgmental because the assessment process involves significant judgment and subjective evaluation of assumptions that may be affected by future operations of the Company, market or economic conditions. \n\n\n\n How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets, including controls over management\u2019s evaluation of the nature of its tax attributes and projections of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income. \n\nWe evaluated the Company's assessment of the realizability of its U.S. deferred tax assets and the resultant release of valuation allowance. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluation of the nature of the Company\u2019s tax attributes, application of the technical tax guidance related to attributes subject to additional limitation, projections of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions used by the Company to assess reliability of its projected future taxable income. We compared the projections of future taxable income with the actual results of prior periods and assessed management's consideration of current industry and economic trends. We also compared the projections of future taxable income with other forecasted financial information prepared by the Company. Further, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the Company\u2019s projections. We involved our tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to evaluate the Company\u2019s assessment of the scheduling of the reversal of existing temporary taxable differences and carryforward amounts and the carryforward lives of its deferred tax assets, and whether the estimated future sources of taxable income were of the appropriate character to utilize the deferred tax assets in the relevant time period. \n\n\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1970. \n\nSan Jose, California \n\nJanuary 29, 2021 \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated January 29, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \n\nSan Jose, California \n\nJanuary 29, 2021 \n\nSupplementary Financial Information (unaudited) \n\nThe Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December.

Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 each consisted of 52 weeks. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company\u2019s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Reclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation and impairment of goodwill and deferred income taxes. Basis of Presentation . Effective in the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), using the full retrospective method, which required the Company to adjust prior reporting periods presented. The 2017 amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements were previously adjusted in the Company\u2019s 2018 Form 10-K to reflect the retrospective application. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or services are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Nature of products and services The Company\u2019s microprocessors (CPUs), chipsets, graphics processing unites (GPUs), data center and professional graphics products, accelerated processing units (APUs), server and embedded processors, and System-on-Chip (SoC) products may be sold as standard non-custom products, or custom products manufactured to customers\u2019 specifications. The Company also provides development services and licenses portions of its intellectual property (IP) portfolio. Non-custom products: The Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers, which includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events. The Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special pricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer\u2019s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Custom products: Custom products which are associated with the Company\u2019s Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment (semi-custom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, based on the value of the inventory and expected margin, over the time of production of the products by the Company. Sales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Development and intellectual property licensing agreements: From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services and a license to the right to use the IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or multiple performance obligations based upon the nature of the arrangements. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control, over time or at a point-in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company\u2019s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The Company has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers. Inventories. Inventories are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost (first-in, first-out method) or estimated net realizable value. The Company adjusts inventory carrying value for estimated excess and obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about anticipated or forecasted demand, estimates of future selling prices, competitiveness of product offerings, market and industry conditions, customer requirements and product life cycles. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory adjustments may be required . Goodwill. The Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. Qualitative factors include industry and market consideration, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. The Company first analyzes qualitative factors. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit\u2019s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying value. Any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Commitments and Contingencies. From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the collectability of amounts owed by customers. The allowance consists of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience. Investments in Available-for-sale Debt Securities . The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in the value of available-for-sale debt securities determined to be other than temporary are included in other expense, net. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method. The Company classifies investments in available-for-sale debt securities with maturities of more than three months at the time of purchase as marketable securities on its consolidated balance sheets. Classification of these securities as current is based on the Company\u2019s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months. Derivative Financial Instruments. The Company maintains a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration some of the Company\u2019s consolidated exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In applying its strategy, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The Company designates these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenue and expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluates hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. To the extent such hedges are effective, the Company records the gain or loss on these contracts as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and it reclassifies such gains or losses to earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Such amounts are included in the same line item in earnings as the associated forecasted transaction. The Company also uses, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. The Company does not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in Other expense, net. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows: equipment uses two to six years , and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements. Leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement. When the Company determines the arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at lease inception, it then determines whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating and finance leases result in the Company recording a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability on its balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable or when the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is not a commonly quoted rate and is derived through a combination of inputs including the Company\u2019s credit rating and the impact of full collateralization. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company\u2019s collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the lease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as the Company has centralized treasury operations. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes any lease incentives. Specific lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when the Company believes it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As allowed by the guidance, the Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. The Company\u2019s finance leases are immaterial. Product Warranties. The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to its approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year . The Company may also offer one to three -year limited warranties based on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. The Company accrues warranty costs to Cost of sales at the time of sale of warranted products. Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions. The functional currency of all of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings. Marketing and Advertising Expenses. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company\u2019s marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Total marketing and advertising expenses for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were approximately $217 million , $176 million and $156 million , respectively. Stock-Based Compensation . The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option\u2019s fair value as calculated by the lattice-binomial option-pricing model. For time-based restricted stock units, fair value is based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under the ESPP using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to PRSUs, which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Income Taxes. The Company computes the provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will be realized. In addition, the Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it expects that its tax positions are more likely than not that they will be sustained, based on the technical merits of the positions, on examination by the jurisdictional tax authority. The Company recognizes any accrued interest and penalties to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Leases. In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , to increase transparency and comparability among organizations for lease recognition and disclosure. This standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet, while recognizing expenses on the income statements in a manner similar to legacy guidance. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2019, using the optional modified retrospective approach, which did not require an adjustment to comparative period financial statements, and recorded $228 million of right-of-use assets and $261 million of lease liabilities primarily related to office buildings on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2018. The Company\u2019s accounting for capital leases, now referred to as finance leases, remains unchanged. The adoption of the new standard had no impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated statement of operations or on net cash provided by or used in operating, financing, or investing activities on its consolidated statement of cash flows. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company elected a transition practical expedient under the new accounting standard allowing it not to separate lease and non-lease components and instead to account for each separate lease component and non-lease component as a single lease component. The Company implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Financial Instruments. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . This standard changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, using a modified retrospective adoption method. The Company will adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2020 and the adoption will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . This standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions to the guidance in Topic 740 related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill and allocating consolidated income taxes to separate financial statements of entities not subject to income tax. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the Company must apply certain aspects of this standard retrospectively for all periods presented while other aspects are applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements had or will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": NaN, "external_audit": "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 consisted of 52, 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company\u2019s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all significant inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation and impairment of goodwill and deferred income taxes. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or services are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Nature of products and services The Company's microprocessors, chipsets, GPUs, professional graphics products, server and embedded processors, and SoC products may be sold as standard non-custom products, or custom products manufactured to customers\u2019 specifications. Non-custom products: The Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers, which includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events. The Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume based incentives and special pricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer\u2019s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Custom products: Custom products which are associated with the Company\u2019s Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment (semi-custom products), under non-cancellable purchases orders and have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, based on the value of the inventory and expected margin, over the time of production of the products by the Company. Sales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Development and intellectual property licensing agreements: From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services and a license to the right to use the IP, which is deemed to be a single performance obligation. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the entire consideration of the arrangement upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer. Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company\u2019s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The Company has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers. Refer to Note 6: Supplemental Balance Sheet Information for further information. Inventories. Inventories are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The Company adjusts inventory carrying value for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory adjustments may be required . Goodwill. The Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. Qualitative factors include industry and market consideration, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. The Company first analyzes qualitative factors. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit\u2019s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying value. Any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Commitments and Contingencies. From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables that are recorded at the invoice amount, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the collectability of amounts owed by customers. The allowance consists of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience. Investments in Available-for-sale Debt Securities . The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in the value of available-for-sale debt securities determined to be other than temporary are included in other income (expense), net. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method. The Company classifies investments in available-for-sale debt securities with maturities of more than three months at the time of purchase as marketable securities on its consolidated balance sheet. Classification of these securities as current is based on the Company\u2019s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months. Derivative Financial Instruments. The Company maintains a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of the Company\u2019s consolidated exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In applying its strategy, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The Company designates these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluates hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings. The Company also uses, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. The Company does not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows: equipment uses two to six years , and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements. Product Warranties. The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to its approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year. The Company may also offer one to three year limited warranties based on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. The Company accrues warranty costs to Cost of sales at the time of sale of warranted products. Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions. The functional currency of all of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings. Subsidies. The Company received investment grants in connection with the construction and operation of certain facilities in Canada and Asia. Generally, such grants are subject to forfeiture in declining amounts over the life of the agreement if the Company does not maintain certain levels of employment or meet other conditions specified in the relevant grant documents. Accordingly, amounts granted are initially recorded as a receivable until cash proceeds are received. In the period the grant receivable is recorded, a current and long-term liability is also recorded which is subsequently amortized as a reduction to cost of sales. The Company also received grants relating to certain research and development projects. These research and development funds are generally recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the underlying grant agreement are met. Marketing and Advertising Expenses. Marketing and advertising expenses include cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Marketing and advertising expenses for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were approximately $176 million , $156 million and $131 million , respectively. Stock-Based Compensation . The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option\u2019s fair-value as calculated by the lattice-binomial option-pricing model. For restricted stock units, including performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under the ESPP using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to PRSUs, which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Income Taxes. The Company computes the provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will be realized. In addition, the Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it expects that its tax positions are more likely than not that they will be sustained, based on the technical merits of the positions, on examination by the jurisdictional tax authority. The Company recognizes any accrued interest and penalties to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) , which creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies in all industries and replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has issued several amendments to the new standard, including clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations. The Company adopted the new standard in the first quarter of 2018, using the full retrospective method, which required the Company to adjust prior reporting periods presented. The Company implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption. The most significant impacts of the adoption of ASC 606 to the Company related to: (1) the acceleration of revenue recognition for sales of semi-custom products subject to a non-cancellable customer purchase order, (2) the acceleration of revenue recognition for sales to distributors, and (3) the timing and financial statement classification of certain development and intellectual property licensing agreements. Revenue from sales of semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchases orders, and that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, is recognized, based on the value of the semi-custom products and expected margin, over the time of production of the semi-custom products by the Company, rather than upon shipment. Revenue from sales to the Company's distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in), net of provision for estimated reserves, instead of the previous revenue recognition which was upon the reported resale of the product by the distributors to their customers (sell-through). For a development and IP licensing agreement executed in 2017, the Company recognized IP-related revenue in the third quarter of 2018 for the entire amount of arrangement consideration upon the completion of all the technology milestones. Previously, the agreement resulted in the reduction to research and development expenses in 2017 for development work as the expenses were incurred and would have resulted in licensing revenue to be recognized in periods beyond 2017 upon completion of the deliverables, based on a fair value allocation of the consideration received. Revenue recognition related to the Company\u2019s other revenue streams remain substantially unchanged. The adoption of ASC 606 had an impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets, but had no impact on cash provided by or used in operating, financing, or investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The impact on the Company\u2019s 2017 and 2016 consolidated statement of operations as a result of the adoption of the new standard is as follows: Year Ended December 30, December 31, As reported Adjustment As adjusted As reported Adjustment As adjusted (In millions, except per share amounts) Net revenue (1) $ 5,329 $ (76 ) $ 5,253 $ 4,272 $ 47 $ 4,319 Cost of sales (1) 3,506 (40 ) 3,466 3,274 42 3,316 Gross margin 1,823 (36 ) 1,787 998 5 1,003 Research and development (2) 1,160 36 1,196 1,008 \u2014 1,008 Marketing, general and administrative 511 5 516 460 6 466 Restructuring and other special charges, net \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (10 ) \u2014 (10 ) Licensing gain (52 ) \u2014 (52 ) (88 ) \u2014 (88 ) Operating income (loss) 204 (77 ) 127 (372 ) (1 ) (373 ) Interest expense (126 ) \u2014 (126 ) (156 ) \u2014 (156 ) Other income (expense), net (9 ) \u2014 (9 ) 80 \u2014 80 Income (loss) before equity loss and income taxes 69 (77 ) (8 ) (448 ) (1 ) (449 ) Provision for income taxes 19 (1 ) 18 39 \u2014 39 Equity loss in investee (7 ) \u2014 (7 ) (10 ) \u2014 (10 ) Net income (loss) $ 43 $ (76 ) $ (33 ) $ (497 ) $ (1 ) $ (498 ) Earnings (loss) per share Basic $ 0.04 $ (0.07 ) $ (0.03 ) $ (0.60 ) $ \u2014 $ (0.60 ) Diluted $ 0.04 $ (0.07 ) $ (0.03 ) $ (0.60 ) $ \u2014 $ (0.60 ) Shares used in per share calculation Basic 952 952 835 835 Diluted 1,039 952 835 835 (1) 2017 and 2016 revenue and cost of sales changes were due to a net drain (decrease in revenue) or net build (increase in revenue) in channel and semi-custom product inventories, respectively. (2) 2017 Research and development expenses increased due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the \u201cAs reported\u201d standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard. The impact on the Company\u2019s affected 2017 and 2016 consolidated balance sheets line items, as a result of the adoption of the new standard is as follows: Year Ended December 30, December 31, As reported Adjustment As adjusted As reported Adjustment As adjusted (In millions) Accounts receivable, net (1) $ 400 $ 54 $ 454 $ 311 $ 61 $ 372 Inventories, net (2) 739 (45 ) 694 751 (60 ) 691 Other current assets 188 3 191 109 6 115 Accrued liabilities 541 14 555 391 9 400 Other current liabilities (3) 57 35 92 69 \u2014 69 Deferred income on shipments to distributors (4) 22 (22 ) \u2014 63 (63 ) \u2014 Accumulated deficit (7,760 ) (15 ) (7,775 ) (7,803 ) 61 (7,742 ) (1) 2017 and 2016 Accounts receivable, net increased primarily due to the acceleration in timing of semi-custom product revenue. (2) 2017 and 2016 Inventories, net decreased primarily due to the acceleration in timing of semi-custom product revenue. (3) 2017 Other current liabilities adjusted primarily due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the \u201cAs reported\u201d standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard. The credits are recorded as deferred revenue under the new standard. (4) 2017 and 2016 deferred income on shipments to distributors is eliminated due to the change in the revenue recognition model for sales to distributors, whereby revenue is recognized upon the shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in), instead of upon reported resale of the product by the distributors to their customers (sell-through). The impact on the Company\u2019s 2017 and 2016 net revenue and operating income (loss) by segments as a result of the adoption of the new standard is as follows: Year Ended December 30, December 31, As reported Adjustment As adjusted As reported Adjustment As adjusted (In millions) Net revenue: Computing and Graphics (1) $ 3,029 $ (52 ) $ 2,977 $ 1,967 $ 21 $ 1,988 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (2) 2,300 (24 ) 2,276 2,305 26 2,331 Total net revenue $ 5,329 $ (76 ) $ 5,253 $ 4,272 $ 47 $ 4,319 Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics (3) $ 147 $ (55 ) $ 92 $ (238 ) $ (5 ) $ (243 ) Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (4) 154 (22 ) 132 283 4 287 All Other (97 ) \u2014 (97 ) (417 ) \u2014 (417 ) Total operating income (loss) $ 204 $ (77 ) $ 127 $ (372 ) $ (1 ) $ (373 ) (1) 2017 and 2016 Computing and Graphics revenue changes were due to a net drain (decrease in revenue) or net build (increase in revenue) in channel inventory. (2) 2017 and 2016 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue changes were due to a net drain (decrease in revenue) or net build (increase in revenue) in semi-custom product inventory. (3) 2017 Computing and Graphics operating income decreased primarily due to the lower revenue from sales to distributors. In addition, 2017 is lower due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the \u201cAs Reported\u201d standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard. 2016 Computing and Graphics operating loss increased due to slightly higher operating expenses. (4) 2017 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income decreased primarily due to lower revenue from sales of semi-custom products. In addition, 2017 is lower due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a certain development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the \u201cAs reported\u201d standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard. 2016 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income increased due to higher revenue from sales of semi-custom products. Stock Compensation. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (ASC 718): Scope of Modification Accounting (ASU 2017-09) to provide clarity and reduce both the (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when changing the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards. Under ASU 2017-09, modification accounting is required to be applied unless all of the following criteria are the same immediately before and after the change: 1. The award\u2019s fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if those measurement methods are used); 2. The award\u2019s vesting conditions; and 3. The award\u2019s classification as an equity or liability instrument. ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 and the guidance did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (ASC 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (ASU 2016-16), which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. This amends current GAAP which prohibits recognition of current and deferred income taxes for all types of intra-entity asset transfers until the asset has been sold to an outside party. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Upon adoption, the Company must apply a modified retrospective transition approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 and the guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Statement of Cash Flows. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (ASC 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15), which is intended to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statement of cash flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows, Restricted Cash (ASU 2016-18), which requires the inclusion of restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 and ASU 2016-18 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The amendments will be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company adopted ASU 2016-18 in 2018, which resulted in the additional presentation of restricted cash on the statement of cash flows for each period presented. The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 in 2018, which resulted in the reclassification of certain cash receipts from operating activities to investing activities on the statement of cash flows for each period presented. The adoption of these standards had no material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Financial Instruments. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments\u2014Overall (ASC 825): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01), which requires that most equity investments be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Entities have to assess the realizability of such deferred tax assets in combination with the entities\u2019 other deferred tax assets. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 with no material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Intangibles. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other\u2014Internal-Use Software (ASC 350-40): Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract , which requires hosting arrangements that are service contracts to follow the guidance for internal-use software to determine which implementation costs can be capitalized. ASU 2018-15 is effective either prospectively or retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating how to apply the new guidance. Reporting Comprehensive Income . In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement \u2014 Reporting Comprehensive Income (ASC 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), which gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Tax Reform Act related to items in AOCI that the FASB refers to as having been stranded in AOCI. The new guidance may be applied retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the Tax Reform Act is recognized in the period of adoption. The Company must adopt this guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued or made available for issuance, including the period the Tax Reform Act was enacted. The guidance, when adopted, will require new disclosures regarding a company\u2019s accounting policy for releasing the tax effects in AOCI and permit the company the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Tax Reform Act that are s"]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": NaN, "external_audit": "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \n\nSan Jose, California \n\nFebruary 8, 2019 \n\nSupplementary Financial Information (unaudited) (1) \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248819000011/amd-12292018x10k.htm"}, "2017": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Fiscal Year . The Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ended December 30, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 , respectively. Fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 consisted of 52, 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company\u2019s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all significant inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation and impairment of goodwill, valuation of investments in marketable securities, deferred income taxes and restructuring charges. Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue from products sold directly to customers, including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured. Estimates of product returns, allowances and future price reductions based on actual historical experience and other known or anticipated trends and factors are recorded at the time revenue is recognized. The Company sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The distributor agreements, which may be canceled by either party upon specified notice, generally contain a provision for the return of those of the Company\u2019s products that the Company has removed from its price book and that are not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Consequently, the Company is unable to readily estimate the product returns and pricing when the product is sold to the distributors. Accordingly, the Company defers the gross margin resulting from the deferral of both revenue and related product costs from sales to distributors with agreements that have the aforementioned terms until the merchandise is resold by the distributors and reports such deferred amounts as Deferred income on shipments to distributors on its consolidated balance sheet. Products are sold to distributors at standard published prices that are contained in price books that are broadly provided to the Company\u2019s various distributors. Distributors are then required to pay for these products within the Company\u2019s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 60 days. The Company records allowances for price protection given to distributors and customer rebates in the period of distributor re-sale. The Company determines these allowances based on specific contractual terms with its distributors. Price reductions generally do not result in sales prices that are less than the Company\u2019s product cost. Deferred income on shipments to distributors is revalued at the end of each period based on the change in inventory units at distributors, on the latest published prices and on the latest product costs. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue under distributor and customer incentive programs, including certain cooperative advertising and marketing promotions and volume-based incentives and special pricing arrangements, at the time the related revenues are recognized. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer\u2019s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Deferred revenue and related product costs were as follows: December 30, December 31, (In millions) Deferred revenue $ 55 $ 124 Deferred cost of sales (33 ) (61 ) Deferred income on shipments to distributors $ 22 $ 63 Inventories. Inventories are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The Company adjusts inventory carrying value for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory adjustments may be required . Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d , goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The Company adopted ASU 2017-04, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Topic 350: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\" , which eliminated step two from the goodwill impairment test. In assessing impairment on goodwill, the Company first analyzes qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The qualitative factors the Company assesses include long-term prospects of its performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not need to perform the quantitative impairment test. If based on that assessment, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying value. Any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Commitments and Contingencies. From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Changes in required reserves could increase or decrease the Company\u2019s earnings in the period the changes are made (See Notes 16 and 17). Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges are primarily comprised of severance costs, contract and program termination costs, asset impairments and costs of facility consolidation and closure. Restructuring charges are recorded upon approval of a formal management plan and are included in the operating results of the period in which such plan is approved and the expense becomes estimable. To estimate restructuring charges, management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and the amount of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities. Severance and other employee separation costs are accrued when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on the Company\u2019s policies and practices and negotiated settlements. Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Accounts Receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the collectability of amounts owed by customers. The allowance consists of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience. Investments in Certain Debt and Equity Securities . The Company classifies its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in the value of available-for-sale securities determined to be other than temporary are included in other income (expense), net. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method. The Company classifies investments in debt securities with maturities of more than three months at the time of purchase as marketable securities on its consolidated balance sheet. Classification of these securities as current is based on the Company\u2019s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months. Derivative Financial Instruments. The Company maintains a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of the Company\u2019s consolidated exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In applying its strategy, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The Company designates these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluates hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings. The Company also uses, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. The Company does not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings. Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting purposes. Estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes are as follows: equipment uses two to six years , buildings and building improvements uses up to 40 years and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements. Product Warranties. The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to the Company\u2019s approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year. Subject to certain exceptions, the Company also offers a three -year limited warranty to end users for those central processing unit (CPU) and AMD A-Series accelerated processing unit (APU) products purchased as individually packaged products, commonly referred to as \u201cprocessors in a box\u201d, and for PC workstation products. The Company also has offered extended limited warranties to certain customers of \u201ctray\u201d microprocessor products and/or workstation graphics or server products who have written agreements with the Company and target their computer systems at the commercial and/or embedded markets. The Company accrues warranty costs at the time of sale of warranted products. Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions. The functional currency of all of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings. Subsidies. The Company received investment grants in connection with the construction and operation of certain facilities in Asia. Generally, such grants are subject to forfeiture in declining amounts over the life of the agreement if the Company does not maintain certain levels of employment or meet other conditions specified in the relevant grant documents. Accordingly, amounts granted are initially recorded as a receivable until cash proceeds are received. In the period the grant receivable is recorded, a current and long-term liability is also recorded which is subsequently amortized as a reduction to cost of sales. The Company also received grants relating to certain research and development projects. These research and development funds are generally recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the underlying grant agreement are met. Marketing, Communications and Advertising Expenses. Marketing, communications and advertising expenses for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were approximately $156 million , $131 million and $154 million , respectively. Cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs are accrued and the costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Earnings (Loss) Per Share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by applying treasury stock method to assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, the assumed issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and the assumed exercise of the warrant under the warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement) with West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala Investment Company PJSC (Mubadala). Potentially dilutive shares shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 ( 2.125% Notes) are calculated using the if-converted method. The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted income (loss) per share: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions, except per share amounts) Numerator\u2014Net income (loss): Numerator for basic and diluted net income (loss) per share $ 43 $ (497 ) $ (660 ) Denominator\u2014Weighted average shares: Denominator for basic earnings (loss) per share 952 835 783 Effect of potentially dilutive shares: Employee stock options, restricted stock units, and warrants 87 \u2014 \u2014 Denominator for diluted earnings (loss) per share 1,039 835 783 Earnings (loss) per share: Basic $ 0.04 $ (0.60 ) $ (0.84 ) Diluted $ 0.04 $ (0.60 ) $ (0.84 ) Potential shares from certain employee stock options, restricted stock units, ESPP and the conversion of the 2.125% Notes totaling 102 million shares for 2017 and potential shares from certain stock options, restricted stock units, the conversion of the 2.125% Notes and the warrants under the Warrant Agreement totaling 231 million and 52 million shares for 2016 and 2015 , respectively, were not included in the diluted net loss per share calculations as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Unrealized holding gains or losses on the Company\u2019s available-for-sale securities and unrealized holding gains and losses on derivative financial instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are included in other comprehensive income (loss). The table below summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component for the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 : December 30, December 31, Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities Unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges Total Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities Unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges Total (In millions) Beginning balance $ (1 ) $ (4 ) $ (5 ) $ (1 ) $ (7 ) $ (8 ) Unrealized gains arising during the period, net of tax effects 1 17 18 \u2014 1 1 Reclassification adjustment for (gains) losses realized and included in net income (loss), net of tax effects \u2014 (7 ) (7 ) \u2014 2 2 Total other comprehensive income 1 10 11 \u2014 3 3 Ending balance $ \u2014 $ 6 $ 6 $ (1 ) $ (4 ) $ (5 ) Stock-Based Compensation . The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option\u2019s fair-value as calculated by the lattice-binomial option-pricing model. For restricted stock units, including performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of the ESPP using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to PRSUs, which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. The application of the lattice-binomial option-pricing model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Significant changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of stock options granted in the future. Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates in order to derive the Company\u2019s best estimate of awards ultimately expected to vest. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Goodwill Impairment. In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) : Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04), which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under the amendments in ASU 2017-04, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual and any interim impairment tests performed for periods beginning after December 15, 2019 on a prospective basis, and earlier adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company early adopted this accounting standard update in the third quarter of 2017 on a prospective basis and did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. The adoption of this update is to simplify its annual goodwill impairment testing process by eliminating the need to estimate the implied fair value of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill if its respective carrying value exceeds fair value. Stock Compensation. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2017 and elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $96 million cumulative-effect adjustment in accumulated deficit and an offsetting increase in deferred tax assets for previously unrecognized excess tax benefits that existed as of December 31, 2016. Since substantially all of the Company\u2019s U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, are subject to a valuation allowance and the realization of these assets is not more likely than not to be achieved, the Company recorded a $96 million valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets with an offsetting adjustment in accumulated deficit. The Company elected to report cash flows related to excess tax benefits as an operating activity on a prospective basis. The presentation requirement for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares did not impact the statements of cash flows because such cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity. Investments . In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, Investments \u2013 Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting (ASU 2016-07), which requires the equity method investor to add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor\u2019s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment qualifies for equity method accounting. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2017, and it did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Inventory. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (ASU 2015-11), which requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost or net realizable value test. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2017, and it did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Derivatives and Hedging . In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (ASU 2017-12), which amends and simplifies existing guidance in order to allow companies to more accurately present the economic effects of risk management activities in the financial statements. ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2019 and does not expect a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. Stock Compensation . In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting (ASU 2017-09) to provide clarity and reduce both the (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when changing the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards. Under ASU 2017-09, modification accounting is required to be applied unless all of the following are the same immediately before and after the change: 1. The award\u2019s fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if those measurement methods are used); 2. The award\u2019s vesting conditions; and 3. The award\u2019s classification as an equity or liability instrument. ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect an impact on its financial statements. Income Taxes . In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (ASU 2016-16), which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. This amends current GAAP which prohibits recognition of current and deferred income taxes for all types of intra-entity asset transfers until the asset has been sold to an outside party. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Upon adoption, the Company must apply a modified retrospective transition approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. Statement of Cash Flows . In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15), which is intended to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statement of cash flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows, Restricted Cash (Topic 230) (ASU 2016-18), which requires the inclusion of restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 and ASU 2016-18 are both effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The amendments will be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company will adopt these guidances in the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect a significant impact on its financial statements. Financial Instruments . In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13). The standard changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2020 and is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. Leases. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASU 2016-02), which increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, lessees must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company will not early adopt the new standard and therefore the new standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of its fiscal 2019. The Company expects that upon adoption the most significant impact will be the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for our operating leases. The Company has established a cross-functional team of key stakeholders for implementing the new standard and has begun to inventory its real estate and equipment leases. As part of the Company\u2019s assessment and implementation plan, the Company is evaluating and implementing changes to its policies, procedures and controls. Financial Instruments. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments\u2014Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01), which requires that most equity investments be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Entities will have to assess the realizability of such deferred tax assets in combination with the entities other deferred tax assets. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods within that reporting period. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company will elect to adopt the measurement alternative, which will apply this ASU prospectively, for its equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. In addition, the Company will record a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for its equity securities that have readily determinable fair values. The Company does not expect the effects of either to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606), which creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies in all industries and replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. Financial Investments. The company maintains short-term and long-term investments, classified as equity method investments, available-for-sale debt securities, equity investments in privately-held entities, and trading securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Trading securities held in connection with non-qualified deferred compensation plans are recorded at fair value, with net realized and unrealized gains and losses and dividend income reported as investment income. For equity investments in privately-held entities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, our accounting policy is to utilize the measurement alternative for valuation of these investments, which permits the company to estimate fair value at cost minus impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price movements. Additionally, the company maintains long-term investments accounted for under the equity method, which requires that the company recognize its share of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) in the investee as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment each reporting period. The company reviews its investment portfolio at least quarterly, as well as whenever facts or circumstances exist which indicate that the carrying value of an investment is greater than its fair value. For investments not carried at fair value, the carrying value of the investment is reduced to its fair value and a corresponding impairment expense is charged to earnings, if events and circumstances indicate that a markdown to fair value is warranted. Declines in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities that are deemed to represent indicators of impairment are charged to earnings as a realized loss. Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The company uses a three-level classification hierarchy of fair value measurements that establishes the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of financial instruments is determined using various techniques that involve some level of estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency and the complexity of the instruments. Derivative Investments. The company occasionally uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. For those derivatives that meet the criteria for hedge accounting and are classified as effective cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects income. The company assesses, both at the inception of each hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. For any hedges no longer deemed effective or for which hedge accounting is not applied, changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings within other non-operating income (expense). There were no outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2022. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are comprised of trade receivables and unbilled revenue. All accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value. Exposure to losses on receivables for clearing and transaction fees and other amounts owed by clearing and trading firms is dependent on each firm's financial condition. With respect to clearing firms, our credit loss exposure is mitigated by the memberships that collateralize fees owed to the company. The company retains the right to liquidate exchange memberships to satisfy an outstanding receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on management's assessment of future expected losses over the life of the receivable, historical trends and the current economic environment within which we operate. Performance Bonds and Guaranty Fund Contributions. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions held for clearing firms may be in the form of cash, securities or other non-cash deposits. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash held by CME may be invested in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities and certain foreign government securities acquired through and held by a bank or broker-dealer subsidiary of a bank, a cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, reverse repurchase agreements secured with highly rated government securities, money market funds or through CME's Interest Earning Facility (IEF) program. Any interest earned on these investments accrues to CME and is included in investment income on the consolidated statements of income. CME may distribute any interest earned on its investments to the clearing firms at its discretion. Because CME has control of the cash collateral and the benefits and market risks of ownership accrue to CME, cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. The cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are considered restricted cash as the cash deposits cannot be used for the company's operations or to satisfy any operational liabilities. Securities and other non-cash deposits may include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, Eurobonds, corporate bonds, other foreign government securities and gold bullion. Securities and other non-cash deposits are held in safekeeping by a custodian bank. Interest and gains or losses on securities deposited to satisfy performance bond and guaranty fund requirements accrue to the clearing firm. Because the benefits and risks of ownership accrue to the clearing firm, non-cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. Property. Property is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method, generally over two to twenty years. Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the respective lease to which they relate or the remaining useful life of the leasehold improvement. Land is reported at cost. Internal and external costs incurred in developing, obtaining, or implementing computer software for internal use which meet the requirements for capitalization are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally two to four years, but up to eight years for certain trading and clearing applications, depending upon expected useful lives. Leases. The company accounts for our leases of office space as operating leases. Landlord allowances are recorded as a direct reduction to the capitalized lease asset, which is reported in other assets and amortized to rent expense over the term of the lease. Both lease and direct non-lease costs are accounted for as a single lease component for purposes of capitalization on the consolidated balance sheets.The associated lease liability represents the present value of lease payments remaining in the lease term and is recorded within current and other liabilities depending upon the balance sheet classification of the payment obligations as short-term or long-term. For sale leaseback transactions, the company evaluates the sale and the lease arrangement based on the company's conclusion as to whether control of the underlying asset has been transferred and recognizes the sale leaseback as either a sale transaction or under the financing method, which requires the asset to remain on the consolidated balance sheets throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds to be recognized as a financing obligation. A portion of the lease payments is recognized as a reduction of the financing obligation and a portion is recognized as interest expense based on an imputed interest rate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The company reviews goodwill for impairment at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The company may test goodwill quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves significant judgments inherent in the analysis, including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for the reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recorded. In certain circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The company performs an impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets at least quarterly or whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for indefinite-lived intangible assets. In certain circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment at least quarterly or when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the carrying value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted net cash flows. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. In connection with this impairment assessment, management also challenges the useful lives of our amortizing intangible assets. Business Combinations. The company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The method requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. The company may use independent valuation services to assist in determining the estimated fair values. Employee Benefit Plans. The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans on its consolidated balance sheets. Changes in that funded status are recognized in the year of change in other comprehensive income (loss). Plan assets and obligations are measured at year end. The company recognizes future changes in actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign Currency Translation . Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured into the functional currency using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. When the functional currency differs from the reporting currency, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while their assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translations are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity. Revenue Recognition. Revenue recognition policies for specific sources of revenue are discussed below. Clearing and Transaction Fees. Clearing and transaction fees include per-contract charges for trade execution, clearing, trading on the company's electronic trading platforms, portfolio reconciliation and compression services, risk mitigation, and other fees. Fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded, the method of trade, the exchange trading privileges of the customer making the trade and the type of contract. The majority of our clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue upon successful execution of the trade. Therefore, unfilled or canceled buy and sell orders have no impact on revenue. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the company, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. A reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The reserve is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as management's estimate of future adjustment activity. The company believes the reserve is adequate to cover estimated adjustments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Market Data and Information Services. Market data and information services represent revenue earned for the dissemination of market information. Revenues are accrued each month based on the number of devices reported by vendors or over a straight line basis in accordance with the market data subscription contract term. The company conducts periodic examinations of the number of devices reported and assesses additional fees as necessary. On occasion, customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment; however, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Other Revenues. Other revenues include access and communication fees, fees for collateral management, equity membership subscription fees and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to customers. Revenue is recognized as services are provided. Concentration of Revenue. One clearing firm represented at least approximately 10% of the company's clearing and transaction fee revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020. Should a clearing firm withdraw from the company, management believes that the customer portion of that firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from the ongoing loss of revenue received from a particular clearing firm. The two largest resellers of market data represented approximately 33% of market data and information services revenue in 2022, 34% in 2021, and 35% in 2020. Should one of these vendors no longer subscribe to the company's market data, management believes that the majority of that firm's customers would likely subscribe to the market data through another reseller. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from a loss of revenue received from any particular market data reseller. Share-Based Payments. The company accounts for share-based payments at fair value, which is based on the grant date price of the equity awards issued. The company recognizes expense relating to stock-based compensation on an accelerated basis. As a result, the expense associated with each vesting date within a stock grant is recognized over the period of time that each portion of that grant vests. Forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur. Marketing Costs. Marketing costs are incurred for the production and communication of advertising as well as other marketing activities. These costs are expensed when incurred, except for costs related to the production of broadcast advertising, which are expensed when the first broadcast occurs. Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. The company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in its consolidated financial statements by using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. The company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Segment Reporting. The company reports the results of its operations as one operating segment primarily comprised of the businesses of CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX and our cash markets business. The individual operations of the company do not meet the thresholds for reporting separate segment information. Newly Adopted Accounting Policies. The company adopted the following accounting policies during 2022: In August 2020, FASB issued an accounting update that simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments and amends certain guidance on the computation of EPS for convertible instruments. This guidance reduces the number of accounting models used for the allocation of proceeds attributable to the issuance of a convertible instrument, thereby eliminating the beneficial conversion feature model. It is also noted that this guidance revises and eliminates certain criteria for achieving equity classification on the balance sheet. This accounting update requires entities to provide expanded disclosures about the terms and features of convertible instruments, including information about events, conditions and circumstances that can affect how to assess the amount or timing of an entity\u2019s future cash flows related to those instruments. The company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2022. Adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": {"Debt": ["DEBT Short-term debt consisted of the following at December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in U.S. dollar equivalents): (in millions) 2022 2021 $750.0 million fixed rate notes due September 2022, stated rate of 3.00% (1) $ \u2014 $ 749.4 \u20ac15.0 million fixed rate notes due May 2023, stated rate of 4.30% 16.0 \u2014 Total short-term debt $ 16.0 $ 749.4 _______________ (1) The company maintained a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 3.32%.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the company revised the presentation of the consolidated statements of cash flows to include cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents within the beginning and ending balances of the reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. Total cash flows from financing activities were revised to include the changes associated with the cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contribution liability. See note 4. Performance Bonds and Guaranty Fund Contributions for additional information on cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions. The prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. The revision in presentation is considered immaterial to the company's overall financial statements and has had no impact on the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of comprehensive income or consolidated statements of equity, including all previously filed financial statements. These cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions cannot be used for the company's operations or to satisfy any operational liabilities.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. Financial Investments. The company maintains short-term and long-term investments, classified as equity method investments, equity securities, available-for-sale debt securities, and trading securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Trading securities held in connection with non-qualified deferred compensation plans and equity securities are recorded at fair value, with net realized and unrealized gains and losses and dividend income reported as investment income. For equity investments in privately-held entities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, our accounting policy is to utilize the measurement alternative for valuation of these investments, which permits the company to estimate fair value at cost minus impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price movements. Additionally, the company maintains long-term investments accounted for under the equity method, which requires that the company recognize its share of net income (loss) in the investee as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment each reporting period. The company reviews its investment portfolio at least quarterly, as well as whenever facts or circumstances exist which indicate that the carrying value of the investment is greater than its fair value. For investments not carried at fair value, the carrying value of the investment is reduced to its fair value and a corresponding impairment expense is charged to earnings, if events and circumstances indicate that a markdown to fair value is warranted. Declines in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities that are deemed to represent indicators of impairment are charged to earnings as a realized loss. Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The company uses a three-level classification hierarchy of fair value measurements that establishes the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of financial instruments is determined using various techniques that involve some level of estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency and the complexity of the instruments. Derivative Investments. The company occasionally uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. For those derivatives that meet the criteria for hedge accounting and are classified as effective cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income. Any realized gains and losses from effective hedges are classified within the same financial statement line item on the consolidated statements of income as the hedge risk. For any hedges no longer deemed effective or for which hedge accounting is not applied, changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings immediately within other non-operating income (expense). There were no outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2021. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are comprised of trade receivables and unbilled revenue. All accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value. Exposure to losses on receivables for clearing and transaction fees and other amounts owed by clearing and trading firms is dependent on each firm's financial condition. With respect to clearing firms, our credit loss exposure is mitigated by the memberships that collateralize fees owed to the company. The company retains the right to liquidate exchange memberships to satisfy an outstanding receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on management's assessment of future expected losses over the life of the receivable, historical trends and the current economic environment within which we operate. Performance Bonds and Guaranty Fund Contributions. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions held for clearing firms may be in the form of cash, securities or other non-cash deposits. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash held by CME may be invested in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities and certain foreign government securities acquired through and held by a bank or broker-dealer subsidiary of a bank, a cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, reverse repurchase agreements secured with highly rated government securities, money market funds or through CME's Interest Earning Facility (IEF) program. Any interest earned on these investments accrues to CME and is included in investment income on the consolidated statements of income. CME may distribute any interest earned on its investments to the clearing firms at its discretion. Because CME has control of the cash collateral and the benefits and market risks of ownership accrue to CME, cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. The cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are considered restricted cash as the cash deposits cannot be used for the company's operations or to satisfy any operational liabilities. Securities and other non-cash deposits may include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, Eurobonds, corporate bonds, other foreign government securities and gold bullion. Securities and other non-cash deposits are held in safekeeping by a custodian bank. Interest and gains or losses on securities deposited to satisfy performance bond and guaranty fund requirements accrue to the clearing firm. Because the benefits and risks of ownership accrue to the clearing firm, non-cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. Property. Property is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method, generally over two to twenty years. Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the respective lease to which they relate or the remaining useful life of the leasehold improvement. Land is reported at cost. Internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use which meet the requirements for capitalization are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally two to four years, but up to eight years for certain trading and clearing applications, depending upon expected useful lives. Leases. The company accounts for our leases of office space as operating leases. Landlord allowances are recorded as a direct reduction to the capitalized lease asset, which is reported in other assets and amortized to rent expense over the term of the lease. The associated lease liability represents the present value of lease payments remaining in the lease term and is recorded within current and other liabilities depending upon the balance sheet classification of the payment obligations as short-term or long-term. For sale leaseback transactions, the company evaluates the sale and the lease arrangement based on the company's conclusion as to whether control of the underlying asset has been transferred and recognizes the sale leaseback as either a sale transaction or under the financing method, which requires the asset to remain on the consolidated balance sheets throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds to be recognized as a financing obligation. A portion of the lease payments is recognized as a reduction of the financing obligation and a portion is recognized as interest expense based on an imputed interest rate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The company reviews goodwill for impairment at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The company may test goodwill quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves significant judgments inherent in the analysis, including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for the reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recorded. In certain circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The company performs an impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets at least quarterly or whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for indefinite-lived intangible assets. In certain circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment at least quarterly or when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the carrying value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted net cash flows. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. In connection with this impairment assessment, management also challenges the useful lives of our amortizing intangible assets. Business Combinations. The company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The method requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. The company may use independent valuation services to assist in determining the estimated fair values. Employee Benefit Plans. The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans on its consolidated balance sheets. Changes in that funded status are recognized in the year of change in other comprehensive income (loss). Plan assets and obligations are measured at year end. The company recognizes future changes in actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign Currency Translation . Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are re-measured into the functional currency using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. When the functional currency differs from the reporting currency, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while their assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translations are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity. Revenue Recognition. Revenue recognition policies for specific sources of revenue are discussed below. Clearing and Transaction Fees. Clearing and transaction fees include per-contract charges for trade execution, clearing, trading on the company's electronic trading platforms, portfolio reconciliation and compression services, risk mitigation, and other fees. Fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded, the method of trade, the exchange trading privileges of the customer making the trade and the type of contract. The majority of our clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched. Therefore, unfilled or canceled buy and sell orders have no impact on revenue. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the company, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. A reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The reserve is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests. The company believes the allowances are adequate to cover estimated adjustments. Market Data and Information Services. Market data and information services represent revenue earned for the dissemination of market information. Revenues are accrued each month based on the number of devices reported by vendors or over a straight line basis in accordance with the market data subscription contract term. The company conducts periodic examinations of the number of devices reported and assesses additional fees as necessary. On occasion, customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment; however, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Other Revenues. Other revenues include access and communication fees, fees for collateral management, equity membership subscription fees and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to customers. Revenue is recognized as services are provided. Concentration of Revenue. One clearing firm represented 10% of the company's clearing and transaction fee revenue in 2021. One clearing firm represented at least 10% of the company's clearing and transaction fee revenue in 2020. No individual clearing firm represented at least 10% of our clearing and transaction fees in 2019. Should a clearing firm withdraw from the company, management believes that the customer portion of that firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from the ongoing loss of revenue received from a particular clearing firm. The two largest resellers of market data represented approximately 34% of market data and information services revenue in 2021, 35% in 2020, and 37% in 2019. Should one of these vendors no longer subscribe to the company's market data, management believes that the majority of that firm's customers would likely subscribe to the market data through another reseller. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from a loss of revenue received from any particular market data reseller. Share-Based Payments. The company accounts for share-based payments at fair value, which is based on the grant date price of the equity awards issued. The company recognizes expense relating to stock-based compensation on an accelerated basis. As a result, the expense associated with each vesting date within a stock grant is recognized over the period of time that each portion of that grant vests. Forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur. Marketing Costs. Marketing costs are incurred for the production and communication of advertising as well as other marketing activities. These costs are expensed when incurred, except for costs related to the production of broadcast advertising, which are expensed when the first broadcast occurs. Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. The company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in its consolidated financial statements by using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. The company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Segment Reporting. The company reports the results of its operations as one operating segment primarily comprised of the businesses of CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX and our cash markets business. The individual operations of the company do not meet the thresholds for reporting separate segment information.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. Financial Investments. The company maintains short-term and long-term investments, classified as equity method investments, equity securities, available-for-sale debt securities, and trading securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Trading securities held in connection with non-qualified deferred compensation plans and equity securities are recorded at fair value, with net realized and unrealized gains and losses and dividend income reported as investment income. For equity investments in privately-held entities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, our accounting policy is to utilize the measurement alternative for valuation of these investments, which permits the company to estimate fair value at cost minus impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price movements. Also, the company maintains long-term investments accounted for under the equity method, which requires that the company recognize its share of net income (loss) in the investee as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment each reporting period. The company reviews its investment portfolio at least quarterly as well as whenever facts or circumstances exist which indicate that the carrying value of the investment is greater than its fair value. For investments not carried at fair value, the carrying value of the investment is reduced to its fair value and a corresponding impairment expense is charged to earnings, if events and circumstances indicate that a markdown to fair value is warranted. Declines in the fair value of available-for-sale securities that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are charged to earnings as a realized loss. Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The company uses a three-level classification hierarchy of fair value measurements that establishes the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of financial instruments is determined using various techniques that involve some level of estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency and the complexity of the instruments. Derivative Investments. The company occasionally uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. For those derivatives that meet the criteria for hedge accounting and are classified as effective cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income. Any realized gains and losses from effective hedges are classified within the same financial statement line item on the consolidated statements of income as the hedge risk. For any hedges no longer deemed effective or for which hedge accounting is not applied, changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings immediately within other non-operating income (expense). There were no outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2020. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are comprised of trade receivables and unbilled revenue. All accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value. Exposure to losses on receivables for clearing and transaction fees and other amounts owed by clearing and trading firms is dependent on each firm's financial condition. With respect to clearing firms, our credit loss exposure is mitigated by the memberships that collateralize fees owed to the company. The company retains the right to liquidate exchange memberships to satisfy an outstanding receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on management's assessment of future expected losses over the life of the receivable, historical trends and the current economic environment within which we operate. Performance Bonds and Guaranty Fund Contributions. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions held for clearing firms may be in the form of cash, securities or other non-cash deposits. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash held by CME may be invested in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities and certain foreign government securities acquired through and held by a bank or broker-dealer subsidiary of a bank, a cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, reverse repurchase agreements secured with highly rated government securities, money market funds or through CME's Interest Earning Facility (IEF) program. Any interest earned on CME investments accrues to CME and is included in investment income on the consolidated statements of income. CME may distribute any interest earned on its investments to the clearing firms at its discretion. Because CME has control of the cash collateral and the benefits and market risks of ownership accrue to CME, cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities and other non-cash deposits may include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, Eurobonds, corporate bonds, other foreign government securities and gold bullion. Securities and other non-cash deposits are held in safekeeping by a custodian bank. Interest and gains or losses on securities deposited to satisfy performance bond and guaranty fund requirements accrue to the clearing firm. Because the benefits and risks of ownership accrue to the clearing firm, non-cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. Property. Property is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method, generally over two to thirty-nine years. Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the respective lease to which they relate or the remaining useful life of the leasehold improvement. Land is reported at cost. Internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use which meet the requirements for capitalization are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally two to four years, but up to eight years for certain trading and clearing applications, depending upon expected useful lives. Leases. The company accounts for our leases of office space as operating leases. Landlord allowances are recorded as a direct reduction to the capitalized lease asset, which is reported in other assets and amortized to rent expense over the term of the lease. The associated lease liability represents the present value of lease payments remaining in the lease term and is recorded within current and other liabilities depending upon the balance sheet classification of the payment obligations as short-term or long-term. For sale leaseback transactions, the company evaluates the sale and the lease arrangement based on the company's conclusion as to whether control of the underlying asset has been transferred and recognizes the sale leaseback as either a sale transaction or under the financing method, which requires the asset to remain on the consolidated balance sheets throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds to be recognized as a financing obligation. A portion of the lease payments is recognized as a reduction of the financing obligation and a portion is recognized as interest expense based on an imputed interest rate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The company may test goodwill quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves significant judgments inherent in the analysis including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for the reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recorded. In certain circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The company performs an impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets at least quarterly or whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for indefinite-lived intangible assets. In certain circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment at least quarterly or when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the carrying value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted net cash flows. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. In connection with this impairment assessment, management also challenges the useful lives of our amortizing intangible assets. Business Combinations. The company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The method requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. The company may use independent valuation services to assist in determining the estimated fair values. Employee Benefit Plans. The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans on its consolidated balance sheets. Changes in that funded status are recognized in the year of change in other comprehensive income (loss). Plan assets and obligations are measured at year end. The company recognizes future changes in actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign Currency Translation . Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are re-measured into the functional currency using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. When the functional currency differs from the reporting currency, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while their assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translations are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity. Revenue Recognition. Revenue recognition policies for specific sources of revenue are discussed below. Clearing and Transaction Fees. Clearing and transaction fees include per-contract charges for trade execution, clearing, trading on the company's electronic trading platforms, portfolio reconciliation and compression services, risk mitigation, and other fees. Fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded, the method of trade, the exchange trading privileges of the customer making the trade and the type of contract. The majority of our clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched. Therefore, unfilled or canceled buy and sell orders have no impact on revenue. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the company, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. A reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The reserve is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests. The company believes the allowances are adequate to cover estimated adjustments. Market Data and Information Services. Market data and information services represent revenue earned for the dissemination of market information. Revenues are accrued each month based on the number of devices reported by vendors or over a straight line basis in accordance with the market data subscription contract term. The company conducts periodic examinations of the number of devices reported and assesses additional fees as necessary. On occasion, customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment; however, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Other Revenues. Other revenues include access and communication fees, fees for collateral management, equity membership subscription fees and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to customers. Revenue is recognized as services are provided. Concentration of Revenue. One clearing firm represented at least 10% of the company's clearing and transaction fee revenue in 2020. No individual clearing firm represented at least 10% of our clearing and transaction fees in 2019. One clearing firm represented 10% of the company's clearing and transaction fee revenue in 2018. Should a clearing firm withdraw from the company, management believes that the customer portion of that firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from the ongoing loss of revenue received from a particular clearing firm. The two largest resellers of market data represented approximately 35% of market data and information services revenue in 2020, 37% in 2019, and 41% in 2018. Should one of these vendors no longer subscribe to the company's market data, management believes that the majority of that firm's customers would likely subscribe to the market data through another reseller. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from a loss of revenue received from any particular market data reseller. Share-Based Payments. The company accounts for share-based payments at fair value, which is based on the grant date price of the equity awards issued. The company recognizes expense relating to stock-based compensation on an accelerated basis. As a result, the expense associated with each vesting date within a stock grant is recognized over the period of time that each portion of that grant vests. Forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur. Marketing Costs. Marketing costs are incurred for the production and communication of advertising as well as other marketing activities. These costs are expensed when incurred, except for costs related to the production of broadcast advertising, which are expensed when the first broadcast occurs. Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. The company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in its consolidated financial statements by using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. The company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Segment Reporting. The company reports the results of its operations as one operating segment primarily comprised of the businesses of CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX and NEX. The individual operations of the company do not meet the thresholds for reporting separate segment information. Newly Adopted Accounting Policies. The company adopted the following accounting policies during 2020: Credit Losses. In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments. The standard requires an entity to estimate its lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance, that when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This forward-looking expected loss model generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The standard also amends the impairment model for available for sale debt securities and requires entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an available for sale debt security is a credit loss. Severity and duration of the unrealized loss are no longer permissible factors in concluding whether a credit loss exists. Entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses on available for sale debt securities immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time. The company implemented this standard on January 1, 2020 by recognizing an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. The company has not experienced significant levels of underpayment or nonpayment by customers and does not expect changes to this trend over the payment terms of our receivables. Exposure to losses on receivables for clearing and transaction fees and other amounts owed by clearing and trading firms is dependent on each firm's financial condition. With respect to clearing firms, the company's credit loss exposure is mitigated by the memberships that collateralize fees owed to the company. The allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable is calculated by evaluating the aging of the company's billings by revenue stream: clearing and transaction, market data, and other. This aging assessment, as well as contemplation of current and anticipated economic factors, including the interest rate environment and pricing levels are the primary considerations that most significantly impact the collectability of accounts receivable. The allowance for accounts receivable is $5.4 million at December 31, 2020. Defined Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. In August 2018, the FASB issued a standards update that modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined pension or other postretirement plans. The guidance clarifies certain existing disclosures and expands the requirements for others. Disclosures that are not considered cost beneficial are removed by the update. Also, there is a new disclosure requirement to include an explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period. This guidance is effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2020. Adoption of this guidance in December 2020 did not have a material financial statement impact as the changes are disclosure-related only. The company has amended its employee benefit plan disclosures to incorporate the new guidance in footnote 11 of this report. Income Taxes. In December 2019, the FASB issued an accounting update that is intended to reduce cost and complexity related to accounting for income taxes. The update removes specific exceptions to the general principles for accounting for income taxes. Specifically, it eliminates the need for an entity to analyze whether the following exceptions apply in a given period: incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation, accounting basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments, and interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The update also simplifies the accounting for the following: franchise taxes that are partially based on income, transactions with a government "]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": {"Debt": ["DEBT Long-term debt outstanding consisted of the following at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in U.S. dollar equivalents): (in millions) 2020 2019 $750.0 million fixed rate notes due September 2022, stated rate of 3.00% (1) $ 748.6 $ 747.7 \u20ac15.0 million fixed rate notes due May 2023, stated rate of 4.30% 18.1 16.4 $750.0 million fixed rate notes due March 2025, stated rate of 3.00% (2) 747.0 746.3 $500.0 million fixed rate notes due June 2028, stated rate of 3.75% 496.8 496.4 $750.0 million fixed rate notes due September 2043, stated rate of 5.30% (3) 743.1 742.8 $700.0 million fixed rate notes due June 2048, stated rate of 4.15% 690.2 689.8 Commercial paper (4) \u2014 303.8 Total long-term debt $ 3,443.8 $ 3,743.2 _______________ (1) The company maintained a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 3.32%.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. Financial Investments. The company maintains short-term and long-term investments, classified as equity method investments, equity securities, available-for-sale debt securities, and trading securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Trading securities held in connection with non-qualified deferred compensation plans and equity securities are recorded at fair value, with net realized and unrealized gains and losses and dividend income reported as investment income. For equity investments in privately-held entities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, our accounting policy is to utilize the measurement alternative for valuation of these investments, which permits the company to estimate fair value at cost minus impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price movements. Also, the company maintains long-term investments accounted for under the equity method, which requires that the company recognize our share of net income (loss) in the investee as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment each reporting period. The company reviews its investment portfolio to determine whether a decline in fair value below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of one or more assets has occurred and is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the carrying value of the investment is reduced to its fair value and a corresponding impairment expense is charged to earnings. Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The company uses a three-level classification hierarchy of fair value measurements that establishes the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of financial instruments is determined using various techniques that involve some level of estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency and the complexity of the instruments. Derivative Investments. The company uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. For those derivatives that meet the criteria for hedge accounting and are classified as effective cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedges is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income. Any realized gains and losses from effective hedges are classified within the same financial statement line item on the consolidated statements of income as the hedge risk. For any hedges no longer deemed effective or for which hedge accounting is not applied, changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings immediately within other non-operating income (expense). Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are comprised of trade receivables and unbilled revenue. All accounts receivable are stated at cost. Exposure to losses on receivables for clearing and transaction fees and other amounts owed by clearing and trading firms is dependent on each firm's financial condition. With respect to clearing firms, our credit loss exposure is mitigated by the memberships that collateralize fees owed to the company. The company retains the right to liquidate exchange memberships to satisfy an outstanding receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on historical losses and management's assessment of probable future collections. Performance Bonds and Guaranty Fund Contributions. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions held for clearing firms may be in the form of cash, securities or other non-cash deposits. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash held by CME may be invested in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities and certain foreign government securities acquired through and held by a bank or broker-dealer subsidiary of a bank, a cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, reverse repurchase agreements secured with highly rated government securities, money market funds or through CME's Interest Earning Facility (IEF) program. Any interest earned on CME investments accrues to CME and is included in investment income on the consolidated statements of income. CME may distribute any interest earned on its investments to the clearing firms at its discretion. Because CME has control of the cash collateral and the benefits and market risks of ownership accrue to CME, cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities and other non-cash deposits may include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, Eurobonds, corporate bonds, other foreign government securities and gold bullion. Securities and other non-cash deposits are held in safekeeping by a custodian bank. Interest and gains or losses on securities deposited to satisfy performance bond and guaranty fund requirements accrue to the clearing firm. Because the benefits and risks of ownership accrue to the clearing firm, non-cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. Property. Property is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method, generally over two to thirty-nine years. Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the respective lease to which they relate or the remaining useful life of the leasehold improvement. Land is reported at cost. Internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use which meet the requirements for capitalization are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally two to four years. Leases. The company accounts for our leases of office space as operating leases. Landlord allowances are recorded as a direct reduction to the capitalized lease asset, which is reported in other assets and amortized to rent expense over the term of the lease. The associated lease liability represents the present value of lease payments remaining in the lease term and is recorded within current and other liabilities depending upon the balance sheet classification of the payment obligations as short-term or long-term. For sale leaseback transactions, the company evaluates the sale and the lease arrangement based on the company's conclusion as to whether control of the underlying asset has been transferred and recognizes the sale leaseback as either a sale transaction or under the financing method, which requires the asset to remain on the consolidated balance sheets throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds to be recognized as a financing obligation. A portion of the lease payments is recognized as a reduction of the financing obligation and a portion is recognized as interest expense based on an imputed interest rate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The company may test goodwill quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves significant judgments inherent in the analysis including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for the reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recorded. In certain circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The company evaluates the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets at least quarterly by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. If the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for indefinite-lived intangible assets. In certain circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment at least quarterly or when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows. If the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value and annually challenge the useful lives. Business Combinations. The company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The method requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. The company may use independent valuation services to assist in determining the estimated fair values. Employee Benefit Plans. The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans on its consolidated balance sheets. Changes in that funded status are recognized in the year of change in other comprehensive income (loss). Plan assets and obligations are measured at year end. The company recognizes future changes in actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign Currency Translation . Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are re-measured into the functional currency using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. When the functional currency differs from the reporting currency, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while their assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translations are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity. Revenue Recognition. Revenue recognition policies for specific sources of revenue are discussed below. Clearing and Transaction Fees. Clearing and transaction fees include per-contract charges for trade execution, clearing, trading on the company's electronic trading platforms, portfolio reconciliation and compression services, risk mitigation, and other fees. Fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded, the method of trade, the exchange trading privileges of the customer making the trade and the type of contract. The majority of our clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched. Therefore, unfilled or canceled buy and sell orders have no impact on revenue. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the the company, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. A reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The reserve is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests. The company believes the allowances are adequate to cover estimated adjustments. Market Data and Information Services. Market data and information services represent revenue earned for the dissemination of market information. Revenues are accrued each month based on the number of devices reported by vendors or over a straight line basis in accordance with the market data subscription contract term. The company conducts periodic examinations of the number of devices reported and assesses additional fees as necessary. On occasion, customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment; however, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Other Revenues. Other revenues include access and communication fees, fees for collateral management and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to customers. Revenue is recognized as services are provided. Concentration of Revenue. No individual clearing firm represented at least 10% of our clearing and transaction fees in 2019. One clearing firm represented 10% of the company's clearing and transaction fee revenue in 2018. One clearing firm represented 13% and another clearing firm represented 12% of clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2017. Should a clearing firm withdraw from the company, management believes that the customer portion of that firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from the ongoing loss of revenue received from a particular clearing firm. The two largest resellers of market data represented approximately 37% of market data and information services revenue in 2019 , 41% in 2018 , and 45% in 2017 . Should one of these vendors no longer subscribe to the company's market data, management believes that the majority of that firm's customers would likely subscribe to the market data through another reseller. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from a loss of revenue received from any particular market data reseller. Share-Based Payments. The company accounts for share-based payments at fair value, which is based on the grant date price of the equity awards issued. The company recognizes expense relating to stock-based compensation on an accelerated basis. As a result, the expense associated with each vesting date within a stock grant is recognized over the period of time that each portion of that grant vests. Marketing Costs. Marketing costs are incurred for the production and communication of advertising as well as other marketing activities. These costs are expensed when incurred, except for costs related to the production of broadcast advertising, which are expensed when the first broadcast occurs. Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. The company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in its consolidated financial statements by using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. The company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Segment Reporting. The company reports the results of its operations as one operating segment primarily comprised of the businesses of CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX and NEX. The remaining operations do not meet the thresholds for reporting separate segment information. Newly Adopted Accounting Policies. In February 2016, the FASB issued a standards update that requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities associated with the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance for lessors is largely unchanged from current accounting rules. Under the new guidance, a lessee is required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current accounting standards, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The company implemented this standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized on the date of initial adoption. Upon adoption of the new standard on January 1, 2019, the company recognized a lease liability of $568.0 million and right-of-use asset of $448.2 million . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments. The standard requires an entity to estimate its lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance, that when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This forward-looking expected loss model generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The standard also amends the impairment model for available for sale debt securities and requires entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an available for sale debt security is a credit loss. Severity and duration of the unrealized loss are no longer permissible factors in concluding whether a credit loss exists. Entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses on available for sale debt securities immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time. The standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The standard\u2019s provisions must be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The company does not believe that the adoption of this guidance in 2020 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued a standards update that modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined pension or other postretirement plans. The guidance clarifies certain existing disclosures and expands the requirements for others. Disclosures that are not considered cost beneficial are removed by the update. Also, there is a new disclosure requirement to include an explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning in 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The company plans to update the disclosures for these changes upon adoption of the guidance in 2021. In December 2019, the FASB issued an accounting update that is intended to reduce cost and complexity related to accounting for income taxes. The update removes specific exceptions to the general principles for accounting for income taxes. Specifically, it eliminates the need for an entity to analyze whether the following exceptions apply in a given period: incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation, accounting basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments, and interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The update also simplifies the accounting for the following: franchise taxes that are partially based on income, transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill, separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax, and enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. This update is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted in any period for which the entity's financial statements have not yet been issued. The company does not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": {"Debt": ["DEBT In March 2019, the company repaid both the \u20ac350.0 million fixed rates notes and the \u00a519.1 billion term loan.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. Financial Investments. The company maintains short-term and long-term investments, classified as equity method investments, equity securities, available-for-sale debt securities, and trading securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Trading securities held in connection with non-qualified deferred compensation plans and equity securities are recorded at fair value, with net realized and unrealized gains and losses and dividend income reported as investment income. For equity investments in privately-held entities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, our accounting policy is to utilize the measurement alternative for valuation of these investments, which permits the company to estimate fair value at cost minus impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price movements. Also, the company maintains long-term investments accounted for under the equity method, which requires that the company recognize our share of net income (loss) in the investee as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment each reporting period. The company reviews its investment portfolio to determine whether a decline in fair value below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of one or more assets has occurred and is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the carrying value of the investment is reduced to its fair value and a corresponding impairment expense is charged to earnings. Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The company uses a three-level classification hierarchy of fair value measurements that establishes the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of financial instruments is determined using various techniques that involve some level of estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency and the complexity of the instruments. Derivative Investments. The company uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. For those derivatives that meet the criteria for hedge accounting and are classified as effective cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedges is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income. Any realized gains and losses from effective hedges are classified within the same financial statement line item on the consolidated statements of income as the hedge risk. For any hedges no longer deemed effective or for which hedge accounting is not applied, changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings immediately. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are comprised of trade receivables and unbilled revenue. All accounts receivable are stated at cost. Exposure to losses on receivables for clearing and transaction fees and other amounts owed by clearing and trading firms is dependent on each firm's financial condition. With respect to clearing firms, our credit loss exposure is mitigated by the memberships that collateralize fees owed to the company. The company retains the right to liquidate clearing firm memberships to satisfy an outstanding receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on historical losses and management's assessment of probable future collections. Performance Bonds and Guaranty Fund Contributions. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions held for clearing firms may be in the form of cash, securities or other non-cash deposits. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash held by CME may be invested in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities and certain foreign government securities acquired through and held by a bank or broker-dealer subsidiary of a bank, a cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, reverse repurchase agreements secured with highly rated government securities, money market funds or through CME's Interest Earning Facility (IEF) program. Any interest earned on CME investments accrues to CME and is included in investment income on the consolidated statements of income. CME may distribute any interest earned on its investments to the clearing firms at its discretion. Because CME has control of the cash collateral and the benefits and market risks of ownership accrue to CME, cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions assets on the consolidated balance sheets can include reinvestments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities. U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities can be purchased by CME, at its discretion, using cash collateral. Securities and other non-cash deposits may include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, Eurobonds, corporate bonds, other foreign government securities and gold bullion. Securities and other non-cash deposits are held in safekeeping by a custodian bank. Interest and gains or losses on securities deposited to satisfy performance bond and guaranty fund requirements accrue to the clearing firm. Because the benefits and risks of ownership accrue to the clearing firm, non-cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements. Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method, generally over two to thirty-nine years. Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the respective lease to which they relate or the remaining useful life of the leasehold improvement. Land is reported at cost. Internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use which meet the requirements for capitalization are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally two to four years. Operating Leases. The company accounts for our leases of office space as operating leases. Landlord allowances are recorded as a reduction to rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. For sale leaseback transactions, the company evaluates the sale and the lease arrangement based on the company's continuing involvement and recognizes the sale leaseback as either a sale leaseback transaction or under the financing method, which requires the asset to remain on the consolidated balance sheets throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds to be recognized as a financing obligation. A portion of the lease payments is recognized as a reduction of the financing obligation and a portion is recognized as interest expense based on an imputed interest rate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The company may test goodwill quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves significant judgments inherent in the analysis including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for the reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recorded. In certain circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The company evaluates the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets at least quarterly by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. If the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for indefinite-lived intangible assets. In certain circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment at least quarterly or when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows. If the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value and annually challenge the useful lives. Business Combinations. The company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The method requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. The company may use independent valuation services to assist in determining the estimated fair values. Employee Benefit Plans. The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans on its consolidated balance sheets. Changes in that funded status are recognized in the year of change in other comprehensive income (loss). Plan assets and obligations are measured at year end. The company recognizes future changes in actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign Currency Translation . Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are re-measured into the functional currency using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. When the functional currency differs from the reporting currency, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while their assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translations are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity. Revenue Recognition. Revenue recognition policies for specific sources of revenue are discussed below. Clearing and Transaction Fees. Clearing and transaction fees include per-contract charges for trade execution, clearing, trading on the company's electronic trading platform, portfolio reconciliation and compression services, risk mitigation, and other fees. Fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded, the method of trade, the exchange trading privileges of the customer making the trade and the type of contract. The majority of our clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched. Therefore, unfilled or canceled buy and sell orders have no impact on revenue. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the the company, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. A reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The reserve is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests. The company believes the allowances are adequate to cover estimated adjustments. Market Data and Information Services. Market data and information services represent revenue earned for the dissemination of market information. Revenues are accrued each month based on the number of devices reported by vendors or over a straight line basis in accordance with the market data subscription contract term. The company conducts periodic examinations of the number of devices reported and assesses additional fees as necessary. On occasion, customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment; however, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Other Revenues. Other revenues include access and communication fees, fees for collateral management and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms. Revenue is recognized as services are provided. Concentration of Revenue. One firm represented 10% of the company's clearing and transaction fee revenue in 2018. One firm represented 13% and another firm represented 12% of clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2017. One firm represented 13% and another firm represented 11% of clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2016. Should a clearing firm withdraw from the company, management believes that the customer portion of that firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from the ongoing loss of revenue received from a particular clearing firm. The two largest resellers of market data represented approximately 41% of market data and information services revenue in 2018 , 45% in 2017 , and 40% in 2016 . Should one of these vendors no longer subscribe to the company's market data, management believes that the majority of that firm's customers would likely subscribe to the market data through another reseller. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from a loss of revenue received from any particular market data reseller. Share-Based Payments. The company accounts for share-based payments at fair value, which is based on the grant date price of the equity awards issued. The company recognizes expense relating to stock-based compensation on an accelerated basis. As a result, the expense associated with each vesting date within a stock grant is recognized over the period of time that each portion of that grant vests. Beginning in 2017, the company recognizes expense for forfeitures of stock grants as they occur. Marketing Costs. Marketing costs are incurred for the production and communication of advertising as well as other marketing activities. These costs are expensed when incurred, except for costs related to the production of broadcast advertising, which are expensed when the first broadcast occurs. Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. The company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in its consolidated financial statements by using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. The company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Segment Reporting. The company reports the results of its operations as one operating segment primarily comprised of the businesses of CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX, and NEX. The remaining operations do not meet the thresholds for reporting separate segment information. Newly Adopted Accounting Policies. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard on revenue recognition that replaces numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges U.S. accounting standards with International Financial Reporting Standards. The new standard introduces a framework for recognizing revenue that focuses on the transfer of control rather than risks and rewards. The new standard also requires significant additional disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments, changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The company implemented this standard as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial adoption. Management recognized an $8.7 million reduction to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2018, which it believes to be an immaterial impact to the consolidated financial statements. The adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings primarily relates to a deferral of a portion of clearing and transaction fees revenue earned and recognized subsequent to the contract trade execution date. The on-going application of the new standard has not resulted in a material impact on the company's financial statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued a standards update that changes how entities measure certain equity investments. It does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities, loans and equity method investments. Under the new guidance, entities will have to measure many other equity investments at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income, unless the investments qualify for a practicability exception. Entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale in other comprehensive income. For equity investments in privately-held entities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, our accounting policy is to utilize the measurement alternative for valuation of these investments, which permits the company to estimate fair value at cost minus impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price movements. The company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2018. During 2018, the company recorded an increase to the fair values of some of its privately-held equity investments of $82.6 million and also recognized impairment charges of $4.7 million , both of which are presented in investment income on the consolidated statements of income. In November 2016, the FASB issued a standards update aimed at promoting consistency in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. Previously, there was diversity in practice as to whether the change in restricted cash was included in the reconciliation of beginning-of-period and end-of-period total cash amounts shown on the statements of cash flows. The amendments require that statements of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, as well as amounts described as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective approach. The statements of cash flows show a decrease in cash balances of $528.8 million for 2018, a decrease in cash balances of $54.3 million for 2017 and an increase in cash balances of $165.2 million for 2016. In March 2017, the FASB issued a standards update that changes certain presentation and disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension as well as other postretirement benefit plans. Defined benefit pension cost and postretirement benefit cost (net benefit cost) are comprised of several components that reflect different aspects of an employer\u2019s financial arrangements as well as the cost of benefits provided to the employees. Under previous accounting guidance, those components were aggregated for reporting in the financial statements within compensation and benefits on the consolidated statements of income. The amendments in the update require that the service cost component is reported in the same line as other compensation costs, whereas the other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented on the consolidated statements of income separately from the service cost component. This update was adopted on January 1, 2018 with retrospective application to the earliest period presented. Total net pension expense remains unchanged upon adoption of the standards update. Following the reclassification, pension expense consists of the following for the periods presented: (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Service cost recognized in compensation and benefits expense $ 19.1 $ 18.7 $ 16.7 Other components of pension expense recognized in other non-operating income (expense) (8.9 ) (1.4 ) (2.2 ) Total net pension expense $ 10.2 $ 17.3 $ 14.5 In August 2017, the FASB issued a standards update that amends the existing hedge accounting model to enable entities to better reflect their risk management activities in the financial statements. The amendments expand an entity\u2019s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components and reduce complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk. The guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same financial statement line as the hedged item. The guidance also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The company early adopted this guidance on October 1, 2018 and believes the impact upon adoption of this standard to be immaterial to the financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance that gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects related to items in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) that were previously stranded within AOCI as a result of applying the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act). An entity that elects to reclassify these amounts must reclassify stranded tax effects related to the change in federal tax rate for all items accounted for within AOCI. Entities can also elect to reclassify other stranded tax effects that relate to the 2017 Tax Act but do not directly relate to the change in federal tax rate. Tax effects that are stranded in AOCI for other reasons may not be reclassified. These amendments should be applied either in the period of adoption as a cumulative adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the 2017 Tax Act is recognized. This guidance is effective for entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The company early adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018, resulting in an adjustment of $3.8 million to reduce beginning retained earnings and increase AOCI. Tax effects from previously stranded items are released from AOCI when the entire portfolio of similar items is liquidated. In August 2018, the FASB issued a standards update that modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements of financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities. Under the new guidance, entities must disclose the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period reported in AOCI for recurring level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period. In addition, entities must provide the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop level 3 fair value measurements. Entities are no longer required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as well as the valuation processes for level 3 fair value measurements. This standards update is effective for reporting periods beginning in 2020, with early adoption permitted for the eliminated or modified disclosure requirements. The amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses, and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop level 3 fair value measurements should be applied prospectively for only the most recent reporting period presented in the initial year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. The company early adopted the disclosure requirements from this standards update starting in the third quarter of 2018 by updating the disclosures in the fair value measurements footnote. In August 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released guidance aimed at expanding certain disclosures while also eliminating outdated or duplicative disclosure requirements. Specifically, the guidance amends the interim financial statement requirements to require a reconciliation of changes in shareholders' equity in the notes or as a separate statement. This statement should reconcile the beginning balance to the ending balance of each component of shareholders' equity for each period where an income statement is required. The guidance is effective for SEC filings beginning on November 5, 2018. As a result, the company will provide a reconciliation of shareholders' equity for the quarter and year-to-date period and comparable periods beginning in the 2019 quarterly reports. The company has also adopted the disclosure requirements from this guidance as applied to disclosures within this annual report by eliminating some duplicative and outdated disclosure requirements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. In February 2016, the FASB issued a standards update that requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities associated with the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance for lessors is largely unchanged from current accounting rules. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current accounting standards, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The update is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Management is on course to comply with the guidance by the effective date as the project team has substantially completed review of the lease agreements and implementation phases. Adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2019 will result in a gross-up of our balance sheet with both a lease asset and lease liability. Presentation of lease expense and the pattern of expense recognition on the consolidated statements of income are expected to remain materially consistent with existing lease accounting guidance. In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments. The standard requires an entity to estimate its lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance, that when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This forward-looking expected loss model generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The standard also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and requires entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an available-for-sale debt security is a credit loss. Severity and duration of the unrealized loss are no longer permissible factors in concluding whether a credit loss exists. Entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time. The standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The standard\u2019s provisions must be applied as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning in 2019. The company does not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued a standards update that modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined pension or other postretirement plans. The guidance clarifies certain existing disclosures and expands the requirements for others. Disclosures that are not considered cost beneficial are removed by the update. Also, there is a new disclosure requirement to include an explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning in 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The company plans to update the disclosures for these changes upon adoption of the guidance in 2021."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": {"Debt": ["DEBT In June 2018, the company completed offerings of $500.0 million of 3.75% fixed rate notes due June 2028 and $700.0 million of 4.15% fixed rate notes due June 2048.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. Financial Investments. The company maintains short-term and long-term investments, classified as available-for-sale or trading securities. Available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Trading securities held in connection with non-qualified deferred compensation plans are recorded at fair value, with net realized and unrealized gains and losses and dividend income reported as investment income. Also, the company maintains long-term investments accounted for under the cost method and equity method, depending upon the degree of influence over the investee as held by the company. The company reviews its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other-than-temporary. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of the assets has occurred and is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the carrying value of the investments is reduced to its fair value and a corresponding impairment is charged to earnings. Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The company uses a three-level classification hierarchy of fair value measurements that establishes the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of financial instruments is determined using various techniques that involve some level of estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency and the complexity of the instruments. Derivative Investments. The company uses derivative instruments, designated as cash flow hedges, to limit exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income. Any realized gains and losses from effective hedges are classified as interest expense in the consolidated statements of income, and any ineffective or excluded portion of a hedge is recognized in earnings immediately. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are comprised of trade receivables and unbilled revenue. All accounts receivable are stated at cost. Exposure to losses on receivables for clearing and transaction fees and other amounts owed by clearing firms is dependent on each clearing firm's financial condition and the memberships that collateralize fees owed to the exchange. The exchange retains the right to liquidate exchange memberships to satisfy a clearing firm's receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on historical losses and management's assessment of probable future collections. Performance Bonds and Guaranty Fund Contributions. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions held for clearing firms may be in the form of cash, securities or other non-cash deposits. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash held by CME may be invested in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities and certain foreign government securities acquired through and held by a bank or broker-dealer subsidiary of a bank, a cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, reverse repurchase agreements secured with highly rated government securities, money market funds or through CME's Interest Earning Facility (IEF) program. Any interest earned on CME investments accrues to CME and is included in investment income in the consolidated statements of income. CME may distribute any interest earned on its investments to the clearing firms at its discretion. Because CME has control of the cash collateral and the benefits and risks of ownership accrue to CME, cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions assets on the consolidated balance sheets can include reinvestments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities with maturity dates of 90 days or less. U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities can be purchased by CME, at its discretion, using cash collateral. Securities and other non-cash deposits may include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, Eurobonds, corporate bonds, other foreign government securities and gold bullion. Securities and other non-cash deposits are held in safekeeping by a custodian bank. Interest and gains or losses on securities deposited to satisfy performance bond and guaranty fund requirements accrue to the clearing firm. Because the benefits and risks of ownership accrue to the clearing firm, non-cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets. Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements. Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method, generally over two to thirty-nine years. Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the respective lease to which they relate or the remaining useful life of the leasehold improvement. Land is reported at cost. Internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use which meet the requirements for capitalization are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally two to four years. Operating Leases. Most leases in which the company is the tenant are accounted for as operating leases. Landlord allowances are recorded as a reduction to rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. For sale leaseback transactions, the company evaluates the sale and the lease arrangement based on the company's continuing involvement and recognizes the sale leaseback as either a sale leaseback transaction or under the financing method, which requires the asset to remain on the consolidated balance sheets throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds to be recognized as a finance lease obligation. A portion of the lease payments is recognized as a reduction of the finance lease obligation and a portion is recognized as interest expense based on an imputed interest rate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The company may test goodwill quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves significant judgments inherent in the analysis including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for the reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recorded. In certain circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The company evaluates the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets at least quarterly by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. If the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for indefinite-lived intangible assets. In certain circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment at least quarterly or when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows. If the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value and annually challenge the useful lives. Business Combinations. The company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The method requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. The company may use independent valuation services to assist in determining the estimated fair values. Employee Benefit Plans. The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in its consolidated balance sheets. Changes in that funded status are recognized in the year of change in other comprehensive income (loss). Plan assets and obligations are measured at year end. The company recognizes future changes in actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign Currency Translation . Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are re-measured into the functional currency using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. When the functional currency differs from the reporting currency, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while their assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translations are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity. Revenue Recognition. Revenue recognition policies for specific sources of revenue are discussed below. Clearing and Transaction Fees. Clearing and transaction fees include per-contract charges for trade execution, clearing, trading on the company's electronic trading platform and other fees. Fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded, the method of trade, the exchange trading privileges of the customer making the trade and the type of contract. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and the trade is cleared. Therefore, unfilled or canceled buy and sell orders have no impact on revenue. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. A reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The reserve is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests. The company believes the allowances are adequate to cover estimated adjustments. Market Data and Information Services. Market data and information services represent revenue earned for the dissemination of market information. Revenues are accrued each month based on the number of devices reported by vendors. The exchange conducts periodic examinations of the number of devices reported and assesses additional fees as necessary. On occasion, customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment; however, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Access and Communication Fees. Access fees are the connectivity charges to customers of the company's electronic trading platform that are also used by market data vendors and customers. The fees include co-location fees, access fees for the electronic trading platform, line charges and hardware rental charges and can vary depending on the type of connection provided. An additional installation fee may be charged depending on the type of service requested and a disconnection fee may also be charged if certain conditions are met. Revenue is generally recognized monthly as the service is provided. Communication fees consist of equipment rental and usage charges to customers and firms that utilize various telecommunications hubs located internationally as well as networks and services in the Chicago and New York City facilities. Revenue is billed and recognized on a monthly basis. Other Revenues. Other revenues include fees for collateral management and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms. Revenue is recognized as services are provided. Concentration of Revenue. One firm represented 13% and another firm represented 12% of the company's clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2017. One firm represented 13% and another firm represented 11% of the company's clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2016. One firm represented 13% of the company's clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2015. Should a clearing firm withdraw from the exchange, management believes that the customer portion of that firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from the ongoing loss of revenue received from a particular clearing firm. The two largest resellers of market data represented approximately 45% of market data and information services revenue in 2017 , 40% in 2016 , and 43% in 2015 . Should one of these vendors no longer subscribe to the company's market data, management believes that the majority of that firm's customers would likely subscribe to the market data through another reseller. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from a loss of revenue received from any particular market data reseller. Share-Based Payments. The company accounts for share-based payments at fair value, which is based on the grant date price of the equity awards issued. The company recognizes expense relating to stock-based compensation on an accelerated basis. As a result, the expense associated with each vesting date within a stock grant is recognized over the period of time that each portion of that grant vests. Beginning in 2017, the company recognizes expense for forfeitures of stock grants as they occur. Marketing Costs. Marketing costs are incurred for the production and communication of advertising as well as other marketing activities. These costs are expensed when incurred, except for costs related to the production of broadcast advertising, which are expensed when the first broadcast occurs. Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. The company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in its consolidated financial statements by using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. The company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Segment Reporting. The company reports the results of its operations as one operating segment primarily comprised of CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX. The remaining operations do not meet the thresholds for reporting separate segment information. Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a standards update that changes certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees. The guidance requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It also allows an employer to repurchase more of an employee\u2019s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The company implemented this standards update as of January 1, 2017 on a prospective basis. Starting in the first quarter of 2017, all income tax effects of awards are recognized in the income statement as part of income tax expense when the awards vest or are settled. For the year-ended 2017, the company recognized a net tax benefit of $13.9 million related to the income tax effects of awards as part of income tax expense. The company also adopted a policy to recognize forfeitures as compensation expense as the forfeitures occur. Previously, the company estimated the number of awards that would be forfeited and recognized the estimate as part of compensation expense. This policy change was adopted on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative-effect adjustment to additional paid in capital and retained earnings as of January 1, 2017. The excess tax benefits are now reported as an operating activity within the change in income taxes payable instead of a financing activity on the statements of cash flows. Prior periods have not been adjusted for this change. The employee taxes paid by the company when the company withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes when restricted stock awards vest are now classified as a financing activity on the statements of cash flows. Prior periods have been adjusted for this change. In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard on revenue recognition that replaces numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges U.S. accounting standards with International Financial Reporting Standards. The new standard introduces a framework for recognizing revenue that focuses on the transfer of control rather than risks and rewards. The new standard also requires significant additional disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments, changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The application of the new standard becomes effective in the first annual period beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. This guidance may be adopted using one of two transition methods: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial adoption (the modified retrospective approach). The company has completed the contract review and implementation phases and will adopt the standard as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Management will recognize a $8.7 million reduction to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2018 upon adoption of the standard, which it believes to be an immaterial impact to the consolidated financial statements. The adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings primarily relates to a deferral of a portion of clearing and transaction fees revenue earned and recognized subsequent to the contract trade execution date. The on-going application of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial statements. The adoption of the guidance will also include expanded disclosures within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued a standards update that will change how entities measure certain equity investments. It does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans. Under the new guidance, entities will have to measure many equity investments at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income, unless the investments qualify for a practicability exception. Entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities classified today as available for sale in other comprehensive income. The update is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The company does not believe that the adoption of this guidance in 2018 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued a standards update that requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities associated with the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance for lessors is largely unchanged from current U.S. GAAP. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current U.S. GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The update is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of the guidance in 2019 will result in the gross-up of our balance sheet to reflect the present value of the lease payments over the lease term and offsetting lease liability at the lease commencement date. Presentation of lease expense and the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement is expected to remain materially consistent with existing lease accounting guidance. In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments. The standard requires an entity to estimate its lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance, that when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This forward-looking expected loss model generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The standard also amends the impairment model for available for sale debt securities and requires entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an available for sale debt security is a credit loss. Severity and duration of the unrealized loss are no longer permissible factors in concluding whether a credit loss exists. Entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses on available for sale debt securities immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time. The standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The standard\u2019s provisions must be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning in 2019. The company does not believe that the adoption of this guidance in 2020 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued a standards update aimed at promoting consistency in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. Previously, there was diversity in practice as to whether the change in restricted cash was included in the reconciliation of beginning-of-period and end-of-period total cash amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The amendments require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, as well as amounts described as restricted cash on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments must be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The adoption of this guidance in 2018 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2017, the FASB issued a standards update that will change certain presentation and disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension as well as other postretirement benefit plans. Under current accounting rules, defined benefit pension cost and postretirement benefit cost (net benefit cost) comprise several components that reflect different aspects of an employer\u2019s financial arrangements as well as the cost of benefits provided to the employees. Those components are aggregated for reporting in the financial statements within compensation and benefits on the income statement. The amendments in the update require that the service cost component is reported in the same line as other compensation costs, whereas the other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component. The amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period for which financial statements have not been issued. The company will change the presentation of certain components of pension cost upon adoption of this guidance in 2018; however, this change will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2017, the FASB issued a standards update that amends the existing hedge accounting model to enable entities to better reflect their risk management activities in the financial statements. The amendments expand an entity\u2019s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components and reduce complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk. The guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The guidance also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The company does not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2017, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a staff accounting bulletin that addresses situations where the accounting is incomplete for certain income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act) by the time an entity issues its financial statements for 2017. The guidance provides for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. Under existing accounting guidance, entities are required to adjust current and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the effects of changes in tax laws or rates at their date of enactment. However, pursuant to the staff accounting bulletin, if an entity does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act at the time an entity's financial statements are issued, an entity may include provisional amounts to reflect its accounting for the change in tax law. The measurement period ends when the company has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year. Additional information regarding the adoption of this guidance is contained in note 9. In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance that gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects related to items in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) that were previously stranded within AOCI as a result of applying the 2017 Tax Act. An entity that elects to reclassify these amounts must reclassify stranded tax effects related to the change in federal tax rate for all items accounted for within AOCI. Entities can also elect to reclassify other stranded tax effects that relate to the 2017 Tax Act but do not directly relate to the change in federal rate. Tax effects that are stranded in AOCI for other reasons may not be reclassified. These amendments should be applied either in the period of adoption as a cumulative adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the 2017 Tax Act is recognized.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include the accounts of the company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. Financial Investments. The company maintains short-term and long-term investments, classified as available-for-sale or trading securities. Available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Trading securities held in connection with non-qualified deferred compensation plans are recorded at fair value, with net realized and unrealized gains and losses and dividend income reported as investment income. Also, the company maintains long-term investments accounted for under the cost method and equity method, depending upon the degree of influence over the investee as held by the company. The company reviews its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other-than-temporary. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of the assets has occurred and is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the carrying value of the investments is reduced to its fair value and a corresponding impairment is charged to earnings. Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The company uses a three-level classification hierarchy of fair value measurements that establishes the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of financial instruments is determined using various techniques that involve some level of estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency and the complexity of the instruments. Derivative Investments. The company uses derivative instruments, designated as cash flow hedges, to limit exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income. Any realized gains and losses from effective hedges are classified as interest expense in the consolidated statements of income, and any ineffective or excluded portion of a hedge is recognized in earnings immediately. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are comprised of trade receivables and unbilled revenue, including clearing and transaction fees and market data and information services revenue. All accounts receivable are stated at cost. Exposure to losses on receivables for clearing and transaction fees and other amounts owed by clearing firms is dependent on each clearing firm's financial condition and the memberships that collateralize fees owed to the exchange. The exchange retains the right to liquidate exchange memberships to satisfy a clearing firm's receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on historical losses and management's assessment of probable future collections. Performance Bonds and Guaranty Fund Contributions. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions held for clearing firms may be in the form of cash, securities or other non-cash deposits. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash held by CME and CMECE may be invested in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities and certain foreign government securities acquired through and held by a bank or broker-dealer subsidiary of a bank, a cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, reverse repurchase agreements secured with highly rated government securities, money market funds or through CME's Interest Earning Facility (IEF) program. Any interest earned on CME investments accrues to CME and is included in investment income in the consolidated statements of income. CME and CMECE may distribute any interest earned on CME and CMECE investments to the clearing firms at their discretion. Because CME and CMECE have control of the cash collateral and the benefits and risks of ownership accrue to CME and CMECE, cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions assets on the consolidated balance sheets include reinvestments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities with maturity dates of 90 days or less. U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities are purchased by CME, at its discretion, using cash collateral. Securities and other non-cash deposits may include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, Eurobonds, corporate bonds, other foreign government securities and gold bullion. Securities and other non-cash deposits are held in safekeeping by a custodian bank. Interest and gains or losses on securities deposited to satisfy performance bond and guaranty fund requirements accrue to the clearing firm. Because the benefits and risks of ownership accrue to the clearing firm, non-cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash contributed by CMECE to its guaranty funds is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements. Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method, generally over two to thirty-nine years. Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the respective lease to which they relate or the remaining useful life of the leasehold improvement. Land is reported at cost. Internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use which meet the requirements for capitalization are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally two to four years. Operating Leases. Most leases in which the company is the tenant are accounted for as operating leases. Landlord allowances are recorded as a reduction to rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. For sale leaseback transactions, the company evaluates the sale and the lease arrangement based on the company's continuing involvement and recognizes the sale leaseback as either a sale leaseback transaction or under the financing method, which requires the asset to remain on the consolidated balance sheets throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds to be recognized as a finance lease obligation. A portion of the lease payments is recognized as a reduction of the finance lease obligation and a portion is recognized as interest expense based on an imputed interest rate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The company may test goodwill quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves significant judgments inherent in the analysis including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for the reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recorded. In certain circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The company evaluates the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. If the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for indefinite-lived intangible assets. In certain circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment at least annually or when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows only if there are indicators of a change in circumstances. If the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value and annually challenge the useful lives. Business Combinations. The company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The method requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. The company may use independent valuation services to assist in determining the estimated fair values. Employee Benefit Plans. The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in its consolidated balance sheets. Changes in that funded status are recognized in the year of change in other comprehensive income (loss). Plan assets and obligations are measured at year end. The company recognizes future changes in actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign Currency Translation . Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are re-measured into the functional currency using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. When the functional currency differs from the reporting currency, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while their assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translations are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity. Revenue Recognition. Revenue recognition policies for specific sources of revenue are discussed below. Clearing and Transaction Fees. Clearing and transaction fees include per-contract charges for trade execution, clearing, trading on the company's electronic trading platform and other fees. Fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded, the method of trade, the exchange trading privileges of the customer making the trade and the type of contract. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and the trade is cleared. Therefore, unfilled or canceled buy and sell orders have no impact on revenue. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. A reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The reserve is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests. The company believes the allowances are adequate to cover estimated adjustments. Market Data and Information Services. Market data and information services represent revenue earned for the dissemination of market information. Revenues are accrued each month based on the number of devices reported by vendors. The exchange conducts periodic examinations of the number of devices reported and assesses additional fees as necessary. On occasion, customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment; however, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Access and Communication Fees. Access fees are the connectivity charges to customers of the company's electronic trading platform that are also used by market data vendors and customers. The fees include co-location fees, access fees for the electronic trading platform, line charges and hardware rental charges and can vary depending on the type of connection provided. An additional installation fee may be charged depending on the type of service requested and a disconnection fee may also be charged if certain conditions are met. Revenue is generally recognized monthly as the service is provided. Communication fees consist of equipment rental and usage charges to customers and firms that utilize various telecommunications hubs located internationally as well as networks and services in the Chicago and New York City facilities. Revenue is billed and recognized on a monthly basis. Other Revenues. Other revenues include processing services revenue, which is revenue generated from various strategic relationships, as well as management fees earned under the IEF programs and collateral management fees. For processing services revenue and IEF revenue, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Concentration of Revenue. One firm represented 13% and another firm represented 11% of the company's clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2016. One firm represented 13% of the company's clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2015 and one firm represented 12% of the company's clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2014 . Should a clearing firm withdraw from the exchange, management believes that the customer portion of that firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from the ongoing loss of revenue received from a particular clearing firm. The two largest resellers of market data represented approximately 40% of market data and information services revenue in 2016 , 43% in 2015 , and 44% in 2014 . Should one of these vendors no longer subscribe to the company's market data, management believes that the majority of that firm's customers would likely subscribe to the market data through another reseller. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from a loss of revenue received from any particular market data reseller. Share-Based Payments. The company accounts for share-based payments at fair value, which is based on the grant date price of the equity awards issued. The company recognizes expense relating to stock-based compensation on an accelerated basis. As a result, the expense associated with each vesting date within a stock grant is recognized over the period of time that each portion of that grant vests. The company estimates expected forfeitures of stock grants. Marketing Costs. Marketing costs are incurred for the production and communication of advertising as well as other marketing activities. These costs are expensed when incurred, except for costs related to the production of broadcast advertising, which are expensed when the first broadcast occurs. Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. The company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in its consolidated financial statements by using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. The company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Segment Reporting. The company reports the results of its operations as one operating segment primarily comprised of CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX. The remaining operations do not meet the thresholds for reporting separate segment information. Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. In the first quarter of 2016, the company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) standards update regarding changes to the presentation of debt issuance costs. The update requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented as a deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability. Previously, debt issuance costs were recognized as deferred charges within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The standards update was applied on a retrospective basis, adjusting all prior periods presented, as if the new accounting methodology was in effect during those periods. At December 31, 2015, $12.1 million of debt issuance costs were reclassified in the consolidated balance sheet from other assets to long-term debt compared with what was previously reported. At December 31, 2016, $11.1 million of debt issuance costs were deducted from long-term debt. The change in accounting policy has been reflected in the table within Note 8. In the first quarter of 2016, the company adopted the FASB's standards update that simplifies the classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The update eliminated the previous requirement to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and non-current in a classified balance sheet. Instead, all deferred tax assets, along with valuation allowances, and deferred tax liabilities are required to be classified as non-current. Companies are still required to offset deferred tax assets and liabilities for each taxpaying component within a tax jurisdiction. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the company adopted this standards update on a prospective basis and classified all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current within the tables in Note 10. Prior period deferred tax assets and liabilities were not retrospectively adjusted. In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard on revenue recognition that replaces numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges U.S. accounting standards with International Financial Reporting Standards. The new standard introduces a framework for recognizing revenue that focuses on the transfer of control rather than risks and rewards. The new standard also requires significant additional disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments, changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The application of the new standard becomes effective in the first annual period beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. This guidance may be adopted using one of two transition methods: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial adoption (the modified retrospective approach). Management is on course to comply with the guidance by the effective date. The project team is currently in the contract review phase, which is expected to be completed by mid-2017. Management expects to reach a conclusion on whether there will be changes in revenue recognition, which method of adoption will be used and the impact the guidance will have on policies, process and controls towards the end of 2017. In January 2016, the FASB issued a standards update that will change how entities measure certain equity investments. It does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans. Under the new guidance, entities will have to measure many equity investments at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income, unless the investments qualify for a practicability exception. Entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities classified today as available for sale in other comprehensive income. The update is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The company is still in the process of evaluating the impact of this update on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued a standards update that requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities associated with the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance for lessors is largely unchanged from current U.S. GAAP. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current U.S. GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The update is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this update on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued a standards update that will change certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees. The guidance will require all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It will also allow an employer to repurchase more of an employee\u2019s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The update is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The company will implement this standards update in the first quarter of 2017 and update the disclosure according to the new requirements. In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments. The standard requires an entity to estimate its lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance, that when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This forward-looking expected loss model generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The standard also amends the impairment model for available for sale debt securities and requires entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an available for sale debt security is a credit loss. Severity and duration of the unrealized loss are no longer permissible factors in concluding whether a credit loss exists. Entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses on available for sale debt securities immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time. The standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The standard\u2019s provisions must be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning in 2019. The company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued a standards update aimed at promoting consistency in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. Previously, there was diversity in practice as to whether the change in restricted cash was included in the reconciliation of beginning-of-period and end-of-period total cash amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The amendments require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, as well as amounts described as restricted cash on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments must be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": {"Debt": ["DEBT Long-term debt consisted of the following at December 31: (in millions) 2016 2015 $750.0 million fixed rate notes due September 2022, stated rate of 3.00% (1) $ 745.2 $ 744.4 $750.0 million fixed rate notes due March 2025, stated rate of 3.00% (2) 744.2 743.4 $750.0 million fixed rate notes due September 2043, stated rate of 5.30% (3) 741.8 741.5 Total long-term debt $ 2,231.2 $ 2,229.3 _______________ (1) In August 2012, the company entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 3.32% .

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include the accounts of the company and its majority-owned subsidiaries.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. Financial Investments. The company maintains short-term and long-term investments, classified as available-for-sale or trading securities. Available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Trading securities held in connection with non-qualified deferred compensation plans are recorded at fair value, with net realized and unrealized gains and losses and dividend income reported as investment income. Also, the company maintains long-term investments accounted for under the cost method and equity method, depending upon the degree of influence over the investee as held by the company. The company reviews its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other-than-temporary. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of the assets has occurred and is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the carrying value of the investments is reduced to its fair value and a corresponding impairment is charged to earnings. Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The company uses a three-level classification hierarchy of fair value measurements that establishes the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of financial instruments is determined using various techniques that involve some level of estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency and the complexity of the instruments. Derivative Investments. The company uses derivative instruments, designated as cash flow hedges, to limit exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income. Any realized gains and losses from effective hedges are classified as interest expense in the consolidated statements of income, and any ineffective or excluded portion of a hedge is recognized in earnings immediately. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are comprised of trade receivables and unbilled revenue including clearing and transaction fees and market data and information services revenue. All accounts receivable are stated at cost. Exposure to losses on receivables for clearing and transaction fees and other amounts owed by clearing firms is dependent on each clearing firm's financial condition and the memberships that collateralize fees owed to the exchange. The exchange retains the right to liquidate exchange memberships to satisfy a clearing firm's receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on historical losses and management's assessment of probable future collections. Performance Bonds and Guaranty Fund Contributions. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions held for clearing firms may be in the form of cash, securities or other non-cash deposits. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash held by CME and CMECE may be invested in U.S. government securities and certain foreign government securities acquired through and held by a bank or broker-dealer subsidiary of a bank, reverse repurchase agreements secured with highly rated government securities, money market funds or through CME's Interest Earning Facility (IEF) program. Any interest earned on CME investments accrues to CME and is included in investment income in the consolidated statements of income. CME and CMECE may distribute any interest earned on CME and CMECE investments to the clearing firms at their discretion. Because CME and CMECE have control of the cash collateral and the benefits and risks of ownership accrue to CME and CMECE, cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets. Performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions assets on the consolidated balance sheets also include U.S. Treasury securities with maturity dates of 90 days or less. U.S. Treasury securities are purchased by CME, at its discretion, using cash collateral. Securities and other non-cash deposits may include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, Eurobonds, corporate bonds, other foreign government securities and gold bullion. Securities and other non-cash deposits are held in safekeeping by a custodian bank. Interest and gains or losses on securities deposited to satisfy performance bond and guaranty fund requirements accrue to the clearing firm. Because the benefits and risks of ownership accrue to the clearing firm, non-cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash contributed by CMECE to its guaranty funds is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements. Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method, generally over two to thirty-nine years. Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the respective lease to which they relate or the remaining useful life of the leasehold improvement. Land is reported at cost. Internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally two to four years. Operating Leases. All leases in which the company is the tenant are accounted for as operating leases. Landlord allowances are recorded as a reduction to rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The company may test goodwill quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves significant judgments inherent in the analysis including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, impairment is recorded. In certain circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The company evaluates the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. If the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for indefinite-lived intangible assets. In certain circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows. If the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. Business Combinations. The company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The method requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. The company may use independent valuation services to assist in determining the estimated fair values. Employee Benefit Plans. The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in its consolidated balance sheets. Changes in that funded status are recognized in the year of change in other comprehensive income (loss). Plan assets and obligations are measured at year end. The company recognizes future changes in actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign Currency Translation . Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are re-measured into the functional currency using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. When the functional currency differs from the reporting currency, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while their assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translations are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity. Revenue Recognition. Revenue recognition policies for specific sources of revenue are discussed below. Clearing and Transaction Fees. Clearing and transaction fees include per-contract charges for trade execution, clearing, trading on the company's electronic trading platform and other fees. Fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded, the method of trade, the exchange trading privileges of the customer making the trade and the type of contract. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and the trade is cleared. Therefore, unfilled or canceled buy and sell orders have no impact on revenue. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. A reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The reserve is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests. The company believes the allowances are adequate to cover estimated adjustments. Market Data and Information Services. Market data and information services represent revenue earned for the dissemination of market information. Revenues are accrued each month based on the number of devices reported by vendors. The exchange conducts periodic examinations of the number of devices reported and assesses additional fees as necessary. On occasion, customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment; however, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Access and Communication Fees. Access fees are the connectivity charges to customers of the company's electronic trading platform that are also used by market data vendors and customers. The fees include co-location fees, access fees for the electronic trading platform, line charges and hardware rental charges and can vary depending on the type of connection provided. An additional installation fee may be charged depending on the type of service requested and a disconnection fee may also be charged if certain conditions are met. Revenue is generally recognized monthly as the service is provided. Communication fees consist of equipment rental and usage charges to customers and firms that utilize various telecommunications hubs located internationally as well as networks and services in the Chicago and New York City facilities. Revenue is billed and recognized on a monthly basis. Other Revenues. Other revenues include processing services revenue, which is revenue generated from various strategic relationships, as well as management fees earned under the IEF programs. For processing services revenue and IEF revenue, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Concentration of Revenue. One firm represented 13% of the company's clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2015 and one firm represented 12% of the company's clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2014 . One firm represented 11% and one firm represented 10% of the company's clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2013 . Should a clearing firm withdraw from the exchange, management believes that the customer portion of that firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from the ongoing loss of revenue received from a particular clearing firm. The two largest resellers of market data represented approximately 43% of market data and information services revenue in 2015 , 44% in 2014 , and 52% in 2013 . Should one of these vendors no longer subscribe to the company's market data, management believes that the majority of that firm's customers would likely subscribe to the market data through another reseller. Therefore, management does not believe that the company is exposed to significant risk from a loss of revenue received from any particular market data reseller. Share-Based Payments. The company accounts for share-based payments at fair value, which is based on the grant date price of the equity awards issued. The company recognizes expense relating to stock-based compensation on an accelerated basis. As a result, the expense associated with each vesting date within a stock grant is recognized over the period of time that each portion of that grant vests. The company estimates expected forfeitures of stock grants. Marketing Costs. Marketing costs are incurred for the production and communication of advertising as well as other marketing activities. These costs are expensed when incurred, except for costs related to the production of broadcast advertising, which are expensed when the first broadcast occurs. Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. The company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in its consolidated financial statements by using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. The company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Segment Reporting. The company reports the results of its operations as one operating segment primarily comprised of CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX. The remaining operations do not meet the thresholds for reporting separate segment information."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": {"Debt": ["DEBT In April 2015, the company repaid the $612.5 million fixed rate notes due 2018 and paid a call premium of $60.5 million .

Visa Inc. (Visa or the Company) is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa operates one of the world\u2019s largest electronic payments network \u2014 VisaNet \u2014 which provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement). The Company offers products, solutions and services that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa\u2019s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company\u2019s investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. During fiscal 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia, impacting Visa and its clients. The extent and severity of the sanctions impacted the Company\u2019s operations and a reduction in Ruble liquidity impacted the Company\u2019s ability to manage operational impact and related foreign currency risk. In March 2022, the Company suspended its operations in Russia. In addition, the Company deconsolidated its Russian subsidiary, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $35 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, which is included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company\u2019s activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities. See Note 4\u2014Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents. Restricted cash equivalents\u2014U.S. litigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 5\u2014U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20\u2014Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. Fair value. The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 6\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments. Marketable equity securities. Marketable equity securities, which are reported in investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include investments in publicly traded companies as well as mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Interest and dividend income as well as gains and losses, realized and unrealized, from changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income (expense). Trading activity in the mutual fund investments is at the direction of the Company\u2019s employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not considered by the Company to be available for its operational or liquidity needs. The corresponding liability is reported in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in the liability recognized in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Available-for-sale debt securities. The Company\u2019s investment in debt securities, which are classified as available-for-sale and reported in investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of securities, which is recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income is recognized when earned and is included in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt securities for impairment on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes an impairment if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company identifies that the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses, the credit loss component is recognized as an allowance on the balance sheet and in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. The non-credit loss component remains in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized from a sale or subsequent impairment. Non-marketable equity securities. The Company\u2019s non-marketable equity securities, which are reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, include investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in non-operating income (expense). The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it does not have control but has the ability to exercise significant influence. Under the equity method, the Company\u2019s share of each entity\u2019s profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company applies the fair value measurement alternative for equity investments in other entities when the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence. The Company adjusts the carrying value of these equity securities to fair value when transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer are observable. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the equity method and the fair value measurement alternative for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entity\u2019s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, accounts receivable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments and derivative instruments. See Note 6\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments. Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the Company\u2019s financial institution clients are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance. Settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa payment services are processed in accordance with the Company\u2019s operating rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by a custodian in an account under the Company\u2019s name and ownership; however, the Company does not have the right to repledge these securities, but may sell these securities in the event of default by the client on its settlement obligations. Letters of credit are provided primarily by a client\u2019s financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment. Guarantees are provided primarily by a client\u2019s parent to secure the obligations of its subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the letters of credit and guarantees. See Note 12\u2014Settlement Guarantee Management. Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. The Company estimates expected credit losses and recognizes an allowance for those credit losses related to its settlement indemnification obligations. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the asset\u2019s remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology\u2019s estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 7\u2014Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Right-of-use (ROU) assets, and corresponding lease liabilities, are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As a majority of the Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not record a ROU asset and corresponding liability for leases with terms of 12 months or less. Lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. The Company does not combine lease payments with non-lease components for any of its leases. Operating leases are recorded as ROU assets, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The current portion of lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company\u2019s lease cost is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and consists of amounts recognized under lease agreements, adjusted for impairment and sublease income. Business Combinations . The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are generally recorded at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. See Note 8\u2014Intangible Assets and Goodwill . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and reacquired rights. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company performed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2022, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company\u2019s indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2022. Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company performed its annual impairment review of goodwill as of February 1, 2022, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2022. Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective and based on a number of factors, including the specifics of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company\u2019s defenses and consultation with internal and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company\u2019s estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 20\u2014Legal Matters. Revenue recognition . The Company\u2019s net revenues are comprised principally of the following categories: service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by client incentives. As a payments network service provider, the Company\u2019s obligation to the customer is to stand ready to provide continuous access to our payments network over the contractual term. Consideration is variable based primarily upon the amount and type of transactions and payments volume on Visa\u2019s products. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, as the payments network services are performed in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. Fixed fees for payments network services are generally recognized ratably over the related service period. The Company has elected the optional exemption to not disclose the remaining performance obligations related to payments network services and other performance obligations which are constrained by and dependent upon the future performance of its clients, which are variable in nature. The Company also recognizes revenues, net of sales and other similar taxes, from other value added services, including issuing solutions, acceptance solutions, risk and identity solutions, open banking and advisory services, as these value added services are performed. Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa payment services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current quarter\u2019s pricing applied to the prior quarter\u2019s payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, value added services, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company\u2019s clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer or financial institution originating the transaction is different from that of the beneficiary. International transaction revenues are recognized in the same period the cross-border transactions occur or services are performed. Other revenues consist mainly of value added services, license fees for use of the Visa brand or technology and fees for account holder services, certification and licensing. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs that provide cash and other incentives designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to Visa\u2019s network and driving innovation. Incentives are classified as reductions to revenues within client incentives, unless the incentive is a cash payment made in exchange for a distinct good or service provided by the customer, in which case the payment is classified as operating expense. The Company generally capitalizes upfront and fixed incentive payments under these agreements and amortizes the amounts as a reduction to revenues ratably over the contractual term. Incentives that are earned by the customer based on performance targets are recorded as reductions to revenues based on management's estimate of each client's future performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional costs are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Company\u2019s income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in non-operating income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 19\u2014Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Company\u2019s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a cash flow matching analysis, with the projected benefit payments matching spot rates from a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is primarily based on the targeted allocation, and evaluated for reasonableness by considering such factors as: (i) actual return on plan assets; (ii) historical rates of return on various asset classes in the portfolio; (iii) projections of returns on various asset classes; and (iv) current and prospective capital market conditions and economic forecasts. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which ranges from approximately 7 to 9 years for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 11\u2014Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Company\u2019s functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations except for Visa Europe Limited (Visa Europe) whose functional currency is the Euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. The terms of these derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges are generally no more than 12 months. The Company uses regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The effectiveness tests are performed on foreign exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to that hedge is reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is recorded. Forward points are excluded from effectiveness testing purposes and are reported in earnings. Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are subject to master netting agreements, which provide the Company with a legal right to net settle multiple payable and receivable positions with the same counterparty, in a single currency through a single payment. However, the Company presents fair values on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company holds foreign exchange forward contracts and other non-derivative financial instruments which were designated as a net investment hedge against a portion of the Company\u2019s net investment in Visa Europe. The Company also holds interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of the outstanding senior notes that allows the Company to manage its interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce the overall cost of borrowing. The Company designated the interest rate swaps as a fair value hedge and the cross-currency swaps as a net investment hedge. Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense) along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in fair value of the underlying hedged item in the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of net investment hedge derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense). The Company utilizes foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative expense for hedges of operating activities, or non-operating income (expense) for hedges of non-operating activities. Cash flows associated with a cash flow hedge are classified as an operating activity on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows associated with a fair value hedge may be included in operating, investing or financing activities depending on the classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows associated with a net investment hedge are classified as an investing activity.

See Note 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13\u2014Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Senior Notes In June 2022, the Company issued Euro-denominated fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering in an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac3.0 billion ($3.2 billion), with maturities ranging between 4 and 12 years. The June 2026 Notes, 2029 Notes and 2034 Notes, or collectively, the \"Euro Notes\", have interest rates of 1.50%, 2.00% and 2.375%, respectively. Interest on the Euro Notes is payable annually on June 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2023. The net aggregate proceeds, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately \u20ac3.0 billion ($3.2 billion). The Company will use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the refinancing of existing indebtedness. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company repaid $1.0 billion of principal upon maturity of its senior notes. The Company\u2019s outstanding senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equally and ratably among themselves and with the Company\u2019s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The senior notes are not secured by any assets of the Company and are not guaranteed by any of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants. Each series of senior notes may be redeemed as a whole or in part at the Company\u2019s option at any time at specified redemption prices. In addition, each series of the Euro Notes may be redeemed as a whole at specified redemption prices upon the occurrence of certain U.S. tax events. At September 30, 2022, future principal payments on the Company\u2019s outstanding debt were as follows: For the Years Ending September 30, 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total (in millions) Future principal payments $ 2,250 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 5,325 $ 2,750 $ 12,620 $ 22,945 Commercial Paper Program Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company issued and repaid $950 million of commercial paper. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no outstanding obligations under the program. Credit Facility On July 25, 2019, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for a 5 year, unsecured $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (Credit Facility), which will expire on July 25, 2024. Interest on borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars under the Credit Facility will be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate or an alternative base rate, in each case plus applicable margins that fluctuate based on the applicable credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt. The Company has agreed to pay a commitment fee which will fluctuate based on such applicable rating of the Company. On October 6, 2021, the Company further amended the Credit Facility to ensure that effective January 1, 2022, interest on borrowings denominated in British Pound Sterling and Euros will be charged at the Sterling Overnight Index Average Reference Rate and the Euro Short-Term Rate respectively or the applicable successor rates, plus applicable margins. The Credit Facility is not governed by any financial covenants. This Credit Facility is maintained to ensure the integrity of the payment card settlement process and for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility."]}, "external_audit": "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ( KPMG LLP , Santa Clara, CA , Auditor Firm ID: 185 ) \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n\nConsolidated Statements of Operations \n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income \n\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity \n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors \n\nVisa Inc.: \n\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u2014(Continued) \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nAssessment of the litigation accrual for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) \n\nAs discussed in Notes 5 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is party to various legal proceedings including the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions, and has recorded a litigation accrual of $1,621 million as of September 30, 2023. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to assess the probability of loss associated with each legal proceeding and estimate the amount of such loss, if any. The outcome of legal proceedings to which the Company is a party is not within the complete control of the Company and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. \n\nWe identified the assessment of the litigation accrual for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) , also known as the MDL \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions , as a critical audit matter. This proceeding involves claims that are subject to inherent uncertainties and unascertainable damages. The assessment of the litigation accrual for the MDL \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions required especially challenging auditor judgment due to the assumptions and estimation associated with the consideration and evaluation of possible outcomes. The Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of merchants\u2019 claims, which could have a material effect on the estimated amount of the liability in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable. \n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company\u2019s litigation accrual process for the MDL \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions . We evaluated the Company\u2019s ability to estimate its monetary exposure by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon resolution of legal matters for merchants that opted out of the previous MDL class settlement. To assess the estimated monetary exposure in the Company\u2019s analysis, we compared such amounts to the complete population of amounts attributable to the remaining opt-out merchants. We performed a sensitivity analysis over the Company\u2019s monetary exposure calculations, and we recalculated the amount of the ending litigation accrual. We read letters received directly from the Company\u2019s external legal counsel and internal legal counsel that discussed the Company\u2019s legal matters, including the MDL \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions . We also considered relevant publicly available information. \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u2014(Continued) \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2007. \n\nSanta Clara, California \n\nNovember 15, 2023 \n\nVISA INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS \n\n September 30, 2023 2022 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316123000099/v-20230930.htm"}, "2021": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Note 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization . Visa Inc. (\u201cVisa\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a global payments technology company that enables innovative, reliable and secure electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries operate one of the world\u2019s largest electronic payments network \u2014 VisaNet \u2014 which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to offer products and solutions that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for all participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa\u2019s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company\u2019s investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Company\u2019s activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. As the effects of an evolving coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic continues, much remains uncertain. There have been no comparable recent events and as a result the ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the extent to which COVID-19 and new variants continue to impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities. See Note 4\u2014Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents. Restricted cash equivalents\u2014U.S. litigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 5\u2014U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20\u2014Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. Fair value. The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are measured at cost and only recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 6\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments. Marketable equity securities. Marketable equity securities, which are reported in investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company\u2019s employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company\u2019s operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income as well as gains and losses, realized and unrealized, from changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income (expense), and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Available-for-sale debt securities. The Company\u2019s investment in debt securities, which are classified as available-for-sale and reported in investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of securities, which is recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income is recognized when earned and is included in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt securities for impairment on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes an impairment if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company identifies that the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses, the credit loss component is recognized as an allowance on the balance sheet and in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. The non-credit loss component remains in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized from a sale or subsequent impairment. Non-marketable equity securities. The Company\u2019s non-marketable equity securities, which are reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, include investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in non-operating income (expense). The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Company\u2019s share of each entity\u2019s profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. The Company applies the fair value measurement alternative for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company adjusts the carrying value of these equity securities to fair value when transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer are observable. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the equity method and the fair value measurement alternative for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entity\u2019s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, accounts receivable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments and derivative instruments. See Note 6\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments. Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the Company\u2019s financial institution clients are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance. Settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa payment services are processed in accordance with the Company\u2019s operating rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by a custodian in an account under the Company\u2019s name and ownership; however, the Company does not have the right to repledge these securities, but may sell these securities in the event of default by the client on its settlement obligations. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment. Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the letters of credit and guarantees. See Note 12\u2014Settlement Guarantee Management. Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. The Company estimates expected credit losses and recognizes an allowance for those credit losses related to its settlement indemnification obligations. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the asset\u2019s remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology\u2019s estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 7\u2014Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets, and corresponding lease liabilities, are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As a majority of the Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not record a ROU asset and corresponding liability for leases with terms of 12 months or less. Lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. The Company does not combine lease payments with non-lease components for any of its leases. Operating leases are recorded as ROU assets, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The current portion of lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company\u2019s lease cost is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and consists of amounts recognized under lease agreements, adjusted for impairment and sublease income. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. See Note 8\u2014Intangible Assets and Goodwill . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and reacquired rights. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company performed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2021, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company\u2019s indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2021. Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company performed its annual impairment review of goodwill as of February 1, 2021, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2021. Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company\u2019s defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company\u2019s estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 20\u2014Legal Matters. Revenue recognition . The Company\u2019s net revenues are comprised principally of the following categories: service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by client incentives. As a payments network service provider, the Company\u2019s obligation to the customer is to stand ready to provide continuous access to our payments network over the contractual term. Consideration is variable based primarily upon the amount and type of transactions and payments volume on Visa\u2019s products. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, as the payments network services are performed in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. Fixed fees for payments network services are generally recognized ratably over the related service period. The Company has elected the optional exemption to not disclose the remaining performance obligations related to payments network services and other performance obligations which are constrained by and dependent upon the future performance of its clients, which are variable in nature. The Company also recognizes revenues, net of sales and other similar taxes, from other value added services, including issuer solutions, acceptance solutions, risk and identity solutions and advisory services, as these value added services are performed. Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa payment services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current quarter\u2019s pricing applied to the prior quarter\u2019s payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, value added services, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company\u2019s clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer or financial institution originating the transaction is different from that of the beneficiary. International transaction revenues are recognized in the same period the cross-border transactions occur or services are performed. Other revenues consist mainly of value added services, license fees for use of the Visa brand or technology, fees for account holder services, certification, licensing and card benefits, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs that provide cash and other incentives designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to Visa\u2019s network and driving innovation. Incentives are classified as reductions to revenues within client incentives, unless the incentive is a cash payment made in exchange for a distinct good or service provided by the customer, in which case the payment is classified as operating expense. The Company generally capitalizes upfront and fixed incentive payments under these agreements and amortizes the amounts as a reduction to revenues ratably over the contractual term. Incentives that are earned by the customer based on performance targets are recorded as reductions to revenues based on management's estimate of each client's future performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Company\u2019s income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in non-operating income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 19\u2014Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Company\u2019s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a cash flow matching analysis, with the projected benefit payments matching spot rates from a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is primarily based on the targeted allocation, and evaluated for reasonableness by considering such factors as: (i) actual return on plan assets; (ii) historical rates of return on various asset classes in the portfolio; (iii) projections of returns on various asset classes; and (iv) current and prospective capital market conditions and economic forecasts. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which ranges from approximately 7 to 9 years for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 11\u2014Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Company\u2019s functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations except for Visa Europe Limited (\u201cVisa Europe\u201d) whose functional currency is the Euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. The terms of these derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges are generally no more than 12 months. The Company uses regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The effectiveness tests are performed on foreign exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to that hedge is reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is recorded. Forward points are excluded from effectiveness testing and measurement purposes and are reported in earnings. Cash flow hedges are subject to master netting agreements, which provide the Company with a legal right to net settle multiple payable and receivable positions with the same counterparty, in a single currency through a single payment. However, the Company presents fair values on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company holds foreign exchange forward contracts which were designated as a net investment hedge against a portion of the Company\u2019s net investment in Visa Europe. The Company also holds interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of the outstanding senior notes that allows the Company to manage its interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce the overall cost of borrowing. The Company designated the interest rate swaps as a fair value hedge and the cross-currency swap as a net investment hedge. Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense) along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in fair value of the underlying hedged item in the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense). The Company utilizes foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative expense for hedges of operating activity, or non-operating income (expense) for hedges of non-operating activity. Cash flows associated with a cash flow hedge are classified as an operating activity on the consolidated statement of cash flows. Cash flows associated with a fair value hedge may be included in operating, investing or financing activities depending on the classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows associated with a net investment hedge are classified as an investing activity. See Note 13\u2014Derivative Financial Instruments . Share-based compensation .

Senior Notes The Company\u2019s outstanding senior notes, or collectively, the \u201cNotes\u201d, are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equally and ratably among themselves and with the Company\u2019s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes are not secured by any assets of the Company and are not guaranteed by any of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants. Each series of Notes may be redeemed as a whole or in part at the Company\u2019s option at any time at specified redemption prices. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company repaid $3.0 billion of principal upon maturity of its senior notes. In August 2020, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering in an aggregate principal amount of $3.3 billion with maturities of 7, 10 and a half and 30 years. The August 2027 Notes, 2031 Notes and 2050 Notes, or collectively, the \u201cAugust 2020 Notes\u201d, have interest rates of 0.75%, 1.10% and 2.00%, respectively. Interest on the August 2020 Notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2021. The net aggregate proceeds, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $3.2 billion. The net proceeds from the offering of the August 2027 Notes will be used to fund eligible green projects and the net proceeds from the offering of the 2031 Notes and 2050 Notes will be used for general corporate purposes. In April 2020, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion with maturities of 7, 10 and 20 years. The April 2027 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2040 Notes, or collectively, the \u201cApril 2020 Notes\u201d, have interest rates of 1.90%, 2.05% and 2.70%, respectively. Interest on the April 2020 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2020. The net aggregate proceeds, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $4.0 billion. The net proceeds from the offering of the April 2020 Notes will be used for general corporate purposes. Commercial Paper Program Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no outstanding obligations under the program. Credit Facility On July 25, 2019, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for a 5 year, unsecured $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"), which will expire on July 25, 2024. The Credit Facility is not governed by any financial covenants. This Credit Facility is maintained to ensure the integrity of the payment card settlement process and for general corporate purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility will be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate or an alternative base rate, in each case plus applicable margins that fluctuate based on the applicable credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt. The Company has agreed to pay a commitment fee which will fluctuate based on such applicable rating of the Company. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. At September 30, 2021, future principal payments on the Company\u2019s outstanding debt were as follows: For the Years Ending September 30, 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Total (in millions) Future principal payments $ 1,000 $ 2,250 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 4,000 $ 13,750 $ 21,000 "]}, "external_audit": "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ( KPMG LLP , Santa Clara, CA , Auditor Firm ID: 185 ) \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n\nConsolidated Statements of Operations \n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income \n\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity \n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows \n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors \n\nVisa Inc.: \n\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u2014(Continued) \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nAssessment of the accrued litigation liability for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) \n\nAs discussed in Notes 5 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings including the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions, and has recorded an accrued litigation liability of $1,441 million as of September 30, 2022. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to assess the probability of loss associated with each legal proceeding and estimate the amount of such loss, if any. The outcome of legal proceedings to which the Company is a party is not within the complete control of the Company and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. \n\nWe identified the assessment of the accrued liability for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement, also known as the MDL \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions , as a critical audit matter. This proceeding involves claims that are subject to inherent uncertainties and unascertainable damages. The assessment of the accrued litigation liability for the MDL \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions required especially challenging auditor judgment due to the assumptions and estimation associated with the consideration and evaluation of possible outcomes. The Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of merchants\u2019 claims, which could have a material effect on the estimated amount of the liability in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable. \n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s litigation accrual process for the MDL \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions . We evaluated the Company\u2019s ability to estimate its monetary exposure by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon resolution of legal matters for merchants that opted out of the previous MDL class settlement. To assess the estimated monetary exposure in the Company\u2019s analysis, we compared such amounts to the complete population of amounts attributable to the remaining opt-out merchants. We performed a sensitivity analysis over the Company\u2019s monetary exposure calculations, and we recalculated the amount of the ending accrued litigation liability. We read letters received directly from the Company\u2019s external legal counsel and internal legal counsel that discussed the Company\u2019s legal matters, including the MDL \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions . We also considered relevant publicly available information. \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u2014(Continued) \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2007. \n\nSanta Clara, California \n\nNovember 16, 2022 \n\nVISA INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS \n\n September 30, 2022 2021 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316122000081/v-20220930.htm"}, "2020": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Note 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization . Visa Inc. (\u201cVisa\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a global payments technology company that enables innovative, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa U.S.A.\u201d), Visa International Service Association (\u201cVisa International\u201d), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (\u201cVisa Europe\u201d), Visa Canada Corporation (\u201cVisa Canada\u201d), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world\u2019s largest electronic payments network \u2014 VisaNet \u2014 which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and seller clients a wide range of products, platforms and value added services. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa\u2019s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company\u2019s investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Company\u2019s activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The worldwide spread of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) has created significant uncertainty in the global economy. There have been no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities. See Note 4\u2014Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents. Restricted cash equivalents\u2014U.S. litigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 5\u2014U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20\u2014Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 6\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments. Marketable equity securities. Marketable equity securities, which are reported in investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company\u2019s employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company\u2019s operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income as well as gains and losses, realized and unrealized, from changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income (expense), and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Available-for-sale debt securities. The Company\u2019s investment in debt securities, which are classified as available-for-sale and reported in investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of securities, which is recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income is recognized when earned and is included in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Non-marketable equity securities. The Company\u2019s non-marketable equity securities, which are reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, include investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The Company adjusts the carrying value of its non-marketable equity securities to fair value when transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer are observable. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in non-operating income (expense). The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Company\u2019s share of each entity\u2019s profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. The Company applies the fair value measurement alternative for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the equity method and the fair value measurement alternative for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entity\u2019s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, accounts receivable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments and derivative instruments. See Note 6\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments. Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the Company\u2019s financial institution clients are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance. Settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa payment services are processed in accordance with the Company\u2019s operating rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by a custodian in an account under the Company\u2019s name and ownership; however, the Company does not have the right to repledge these securities, but may sell these securities in the event of default by the client on its settlement obligations. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment. Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the letters of credit and guarantees. See Note 12\u2014Settlement Guarantee Management. Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the asset\u2019s remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology\u2019s estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 7\u2014Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets, and corresponding lease liabilities, are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As a majority of the Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not record a ROU asset and corresponding liability for leases with terms of 12 months or less. The Company does not include renewals in the determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease commencement. Lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. The Company does not combine lease payments with non-lease components for any of its leases. Operating leases are recorded as ROU assets, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The current portion of lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company\u2019s lease cost consists of amounts recognized under lease agreements in the results of operations adjusted for impairment and sublease income. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reseller relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2020. See Note 8\u2014Intangible Assets and Goodwill . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and reacquired rights. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2020, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company\u2019s indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2020. Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment as of February 1, 2020, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2020. Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company\u2019s defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company\u2019s estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 20\u2014Legal Matters. Revenue recognition . The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09 effective October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. Results for reporting periods beginning after October 1, 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard. The comparative prior period amounts appearing on the financial statements have not been restated and continue to be reported under the prior revenue standard. The Company\u2019s net revenues are comprised principally of the following categories: service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by client incentives. As a payment network service provider, the Company\u2019s obligation to the customer is to stand ready to provide continuous access to our payment network over the contractual term. Consideration is variable based primarily upon the amount and type of transactions and payments volume on Visa\u2019s products. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, as the payment network services are performed in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. Fixed fees for payment network services are generally recognized ratably over the related service period. The Company has elected the optional exemption to not disclose the remaining performance obligations related to payment network services and other performance obligations which are constrained by and dependent upon the future performance of its clients, which are variable in nature. The Company also recognizes revenues, net of sales and other similar taxes, from other value added services, including issuer and consumer solutions, merchant and acquirer solutions, fraud management and security services, data products, and consulting and analytics, as these value added services are performed. Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa payment services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current quarter\u2019s pricing applied to the prior quarter\u2019s payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, value added services, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company\u2019s clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer or financial institution originating the transaction is different from that of the beneficiary. International transaction revenues are recognized in the same period the cross-border transactions occur or services are performed. Other revenues consist mainly of value added services, license fees for use of the Visa brand or technology, fees for account holder services, certification, licensing and product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to Visa\u2019s network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to revenues. Client incentives are accounted for as operating expenses if the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service provided by the customer. The Company generally capitalizes upfront and fixed incentive payments under these agreements and amortizes the amounts as a reduction to revenues ratably over the contractual term. Incentives that are earned by the customer based on performance targets are recorded as reductions to revenues based on management's estimate of each client's future performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Company\u2019s income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in non-operating income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 19\u2014Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Company\u2019s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a cash flow matching analysis, with the projected benefit payments matching spot rates from a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is primarily based on the targeted allocation, and evaluated for reasonableness by considering such factors as: (i) actual return on plan assets; (ii) historical rates of return on various asset classes in the portfolio; (iii) projections of returns on various asset classes; and (iv) current and prospective capital market conditions and economic forecasts. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which ranges from approximately 6 to 10 years for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 11\u2014Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Company\u2019s functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations except for Visa Europe whose functional currency is the euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. The terms of these derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges are generally less than 12 months. To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between the hedging transactions and the hedged items, as well as the Company\u2019s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is recorded. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative expense for hedges of operating activity, or non-operating income (expense) for hedges of non-operating activity. Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense) along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations. The change in value of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense). Cash flows associated with derivatives designated as a fair value hedge may be included in operating, investing or financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows, depending on the classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows associated with financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as an investing activity. See Note 13\u2014Derivative Financial Instruments . Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management\u2019s best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 17\u2014Share-based Compensation. Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 16\u2014Earnings Per Share. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to this new lease standard that address the transition methods available and clarify the guidance for lessor costs a"]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["Note 18\u2014Commitments and Contingencies Commitments.

Senior Notes The Company\u2019s outstanding senior notes, or collectively, the \u201cNotes\u201d, are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equally and ratably among themselves and with the Company\u2019s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes are not secured by any assets of the Company and are not guaranteed by any of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries. The Company was in compliance with all related covenants as of September 30, 2020. Each series of Notes may be redeemed as a whole or in part at the Company\u2019s option at any time at specified redemption prices. In August 2020, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering in an aggregate principal amount of $3.3 billion with maturities of 7, 10 and a half and 30 years. The August 2027 Notes, 2031 Notes and 2050 Notes, or collectively, the \u201cAugust 2020 Notes\u201d, have interest rates of 0.75%, 1.10% and 2.00%, respectively. Interest on the August 2020 Notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2021. The net aggregate proceeds, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $3.2 billion. The net proceeds from the offering of the August 2027 Notes will be used to fund eligible green projects and the net proceeds from the offering of the 2031 Notes and 2050 Notes will be used for general corporate purposes. In April 2020, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion with maturities of 7, 10 and 20 years. The April 2027 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2040 Notes, or collectively, the \u201cApril 2020 Notes\u201d, have interest rates of 1.90%, 2.05% and 2.70%, respectively. Interest on the April 2020 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2020. The net aggregate proceeds, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $4.0 billion. The net proceeds from the offering of the April 2020 Notes will be used for general corporate purposes. Commercial Paper Program Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. The Company had no outstanding obligations under the program as of September 30, 2020 and 2019. Credit Facility On July 25, 2019, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for a 5 year, unsecured $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"), which will expire on July 25, 2024. The Credit Facility is not governed by any financial covenants. This Credit Facility is maintained to ensure the integrity of the payment card settlement process and for general corporate purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility will be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate or an alternative base rate, in each case plus applicable margins that fluctuate based on the applicable credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt. The Company has agreed to pay a commitment fee which will fluctuate based on such applicable rating of the Company. The Company had no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2020 and 2019. At September 30, 2020, future principal payments on the Company\u2019s outstanding debt were as follows: For the Years Ending September 30, 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Total (in millions) Future principal payments $ 3,000 $ 1,000 $ 2,250 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 17,750 $ 24,000 "]}, "external_audit": "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n\nConsolidated Statements of Operations \n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income \n\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity \n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows \n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors \n\nVisa Inc.: \n\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u2014(Continued) \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nAssessment of the accrued litigation liability for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) \n\nAs discussed in Notes 5 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings including the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions, and has recorded an accrued litigation liability of $881 million as of September 30, 2021. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to assess the probability of loss associated with each legal proceeding and amount of such loss, if any. The outcome of legal proceedings to which the Company is a party is not within the complete control of the Company or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. \n\nWe identified the assessment of the accrued liability for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement, also known as the MDL \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions , as a critical audit matter. This proceeding involves complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. The assessment of the accrued litigation liability for the MDL \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions required especially challenging auditor judgment due to the assumptions and estimation associated with the consideration and evaluation of possible outcomes. Changes to the outcome could have a significant effect on the estimated amount of the liability. \n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s litigation accrual process for the MDL \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions . We assessed the amounts accrued by reading letters received directly from the Company\u2019s external legal counsel and in-house legal counsel that discussed the Company\u2019s legal matters, including the MDL \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions . We considered relevant publicly available information, such as published news articles about the Company and its legal matters, including the MDL \u2013 Individual Merchant Actions . We evaluated the Company\u2019s ability to estimate its monetary exposure by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon resolution of legal matters for merchants that opted out of the previous MDL class settlement. To assess the estimated monetary exposure in the Company\u2019s analysis, we compared such amounts to the complete population of amounts attributable to opt-out merchants. We also performed sensitivity analysis over the Company\u2019s monetary exposure calculations. \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u2014(Continued) \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2007. \n\nSanta Clara, California \n\nNovember 18, 2021 \n\nVISA INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS \n\n September 30, 2021 2020 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316121000060/v-20210930.htm"}, "2019": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Note 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization . Visa Inc. (\u201cVisa\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa U.S.A.\u201d), Visa International Service Association (\u201cVisa International\u201d), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (\u201cVisa Europe\u201d), Visa Canada Corporation (\u201cVisa Canada\u201d), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world\u2019s largest electronic payments network \u2014 VisaNet \u2014 which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and seller clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa\u2019s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company\u2019s investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Company\u2019s activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities. See Note 4\u2014Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents . Restricted cash equivalents\u2014U.S. litigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 5\u2014U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20\u2014Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 6\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The classification of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company\u2019s Level 1 assets include money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Level 2 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company\u2019s Level 2 assets and liabilities include U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, and derivative instruments. Level 3 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The Company\u2019s Level 3 assets include non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method. Marketable equity securities. Marketable equity securities, which are reported in investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company\u2019s employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company\u2019s operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 changed the Company\u2019s accounting for marketable equity securities. Beginning on October 1, 2018, unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of marketable equity securities are recognized in non-operating income (expense). Available-for-sale debt securities. The Company\u2019s investment in debt securities, which are classified as available-for-sale and reported in investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. These investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of securities, which is recorded in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income is recognized when earned and is included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Non-marketable equity securities. The Company\u2019s non-marketable equity securities, which are reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, include investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management\u2019s judgment. Adoption of ASU 2016-01 changed the Company\u2019s accounting for non-marketable equity securities. Beginning on October 1, 2018, the Company\u2019s policy is to adjust the carrying value of its non-marketable equity securities to fair value when transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer are observable. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in non-operating income (expense). The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Company\u2019s share of each entity\u2019s profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. The Company applies the fair value measurement alternative for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the equity method and the fair value measurement alternative for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entity\u2019s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash equivalents\u2014U.S. litigation escrow, investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, accounts receivable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments and derivative instruments. See Note 6\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the Company\u2019s financial institution clients are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance. Settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa payment services are processed in accordance with the Company\u2019s rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by a custodian in an account under the Company\u2019s name and ownership; however, the Company does not have the right to repledge these securities, but may sell these securities in the event of default by the client on its settlement obligations. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment. Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the letters of credit and guarantees. See Note 11\u2014Settlement Guarantee Management . Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the asset\u2019s remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology\u2019s estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 7\u2014Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company enters into operating leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements, which may or may not contain lease incentives, is primarily recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2019 . See Note 8\u2014Intangible Assets and Goodwill . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and reacquired rights. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2019 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company\u2019s indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2019 . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment as of February 1, 2019 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2019 . Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company\u2019s defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company\u2019s estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 20\u2014Legal Matters . Revenue recognition . The Company\u2019s net revenues are comprised principally of the following categories: service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by client incentives. As a payment network service provider, the Company\u2019s obligation to the customer is to stand ready to provide continuous access to our payment network over the contractual term. Consideration is variable based primarily upon the amount and type of transactions and payments volume on Visa\u2019s products. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, as the payment network services are performed in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. Fixed fees for payment network services are generally recognized ratably over the related service period. The Company has elected the optional exemption to not disclose the remaining performance obligations related to payment network services. Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa payment services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current quarter\u2019s pricing applied to the prior quarter\u2019s payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, value-added services, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company\u2019s clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer or financial institution originating the transaction is different from that of the beneficiary. International transaction revenues are recognized in the same period the cross-border transactions occur or services are performed. Other revenues consist mainly of value-added services, license fees for use of the Visa brand or technology, fees for account holder services, certification, licensing and product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to Visa\u2019s network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to revenues. Client incentives are accounted for as operating expenses if the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service provided by the customer. The Company generally capitalizes upfront and fixed incentive payments under these agreements and amortizes the amounts as a reduction to revenues ratably over the contractual term. Incentives that are earned by the customer based on performance targets are recorded as reductions to revenues based on management's estimate of each client's future performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Company\u2019s income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 19\u2014Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Company\u2019s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a cash flow matching analysis, with the projected benefit payments matching spot rates from a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately 7 years for the U.S. plans and 10 years for the Visa Europe UK pension plan. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 10\u2014Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Company\u2019s functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations except for Visa Europe whose functional currency is the euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between the hedging transactions and the hedged items, as well as the Company\u2019s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets, non-current other assets, accrued liabilities or non-current other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative for hedges of operating activity, or non-operating income (expense) for hedges of non-operating activity. Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense) along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations. The change in value of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense). Cash flows associated with derivatives designated as a fair value hedge may be included in operating, investing or financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows, depending on the classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows associated with financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as an investing activity. See Note 12\u2014Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Non-derivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge. The Company designated the euro-denominated deferred cash consideration liability, a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the Company\u2019s euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe. Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to the change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the euro-denominated net investment, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. See Note 12\u2014Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management\u2019s best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 16\u2014Share-based Compensation . Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 15\u2014Earnings Per Share . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. This new revenue standard replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to the new revenue standard. The new revenue standard changes the classification and timing of recognition of certain client incentives and marketing-related funds paid to customers, as well as revenues and expenses for market development funds and services provided to customers as an incentive. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospectiv"]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["Note 17\u2014Commitments and Contingencies Commitments.

We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nChanges in Accounting Principle \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers in the year ended September 30, 2019 due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09 \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u2014(Continued) \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nAssessment of the accrued litigation liability for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) \n\nAs discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings including the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions , and has recorded an accrued litigation liability of $914 million as of September 30, 2020. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to assess the probability of loss associated with each legal proceeding and amount of such loss, if any. The outcome of legal proceedings to which the Company is a party is not within the complete control of the Company or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. \n\nWe identified the assessment of the accrued liability for class matters opting out of the Damages Class settlement, also known as the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions, as a critical audit matter. This proceeding involves complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. The assessment of the accrued litigation liability for the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions required especially challenging auditor judgment due to the assumptions and estimates associated with the consideration and evaluation of possible outcomes. Changes to the outcome could have a significant effect on the estimated amount of the liability. \n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s litigation accrual process, including internal controls over the Company\u2019s litigation accrual process for the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions . We assessed the amounts accrued by reading letters received directly from the Company\u2019s external legal counsel and in-house legal counsel that discussed the Company\u2019s legal matters, including the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions . We considered relevant publicly available information, such as published news articles, about the Company and its legal matters, including the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions . We evaluated the Company\u2019s ability to estimate its monetary exposure by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon resolution of legal matters for merchants that opted out of the previous MDL class settlement. To assess the estimated monetary exposure in the Company's analysis, we compared such amounts to the complete population of amounts attributable to opt-out merchants. We also performed sensitivity analysis over the Company's monetary exposure calculations. \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u2014(Continued) \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2007. \n\nSanta Clara, California \n\nNovember 19, 2020 \n\nVISA INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS \n\n September 30, 2020 2019 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316120000070/v-20200930.htm"}, "2018": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Note 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization . Visa Inc. (\u201cVisa\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa U.S.A.\u201d), Visa International Service Association (\u201cVisa International\u201d), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (\u201cVisa Europe\u201d), Visa Canada Corporation (\u201cVisa Canada\u201d), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world\u2019s largest retail electronic payments network \u2014 VisaNet \u2014 which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa\u2019s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company\u2019s investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Company\u2019s activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. Restricted cash\u2014U.S. litigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 2\u2014U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17\u2014Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 3\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The classification of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company\u2019s Level 1 assets include money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Level 2 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company\u2019s Level 2 assets and liabilities include commercial paper, U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, corporate debt securities and foreign exchange derivative instruments. Level 3 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The Company\u2019s Level 3 assets include non-marketable equity investments and investments accounted for under the equity method. Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company\u2019s employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company\u2019s operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Available-for-sale investment securities include investments in debt and equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. These investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities, which is recorded in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned and are included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt or equity security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Company\u2019s share of each entity\u2019s profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. The Company applies the cost method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entity\u2019s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash\u2014U.S. litigation escrow, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments, settlement risk guarantee, and derivative instruments. See Note 3\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the Company\u2019s financial institution clients are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa payment products are processed in accordance with the Company\u2019s rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets, excluding certain cash collateral for which clients retain beneficial ownership and the cash is only accessible to the Company in the event of default by the client on its settled obligations. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by a custodian in an account under the Company\u2019s name and ownership; however, the Company does not have the right to repledge these securities, but may sell these securities in the event of default by the client on its settlement obligations. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment. Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the letters of credit and guarantees. See Note 8\u2014Settlement Guarantee Management . Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the asset\u2019s remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology\u2019s estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 4\u2014Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements, which may or may not contain lease incentives, is primarily recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2018 . See Note 5\u2014Intangible Assets and Goodwill . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and reacquired rights. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2018 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company\u2019s indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2018 . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment as of February 1, 2018 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2018 . Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company\u2019s defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company\u2019s estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 17\u2014Legal Matters . Revenue recognition . The Company\u2019s operating revenues consist of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter\u2019s payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company\u2019s clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, fees for account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Company\u2019s acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Prior to the acquisition of Visa Europe, other revenues also included revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement. Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to Visa\u2019s network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established. The Company generally capitalizes advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management\u2019s ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management\u2019s estimate of each client\u2019s performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Company\u2019s income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 16\u2014Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Company\u2019s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a cash flow matching analysis, with the projected benefit payments matching spot rates from a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately 9 years for the U.S. plans and 11 years for the Visa Europe UK pension plan. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 7\u2014Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Company\u2019s functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations except for Visa Europe whose functional currency is the euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016. Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between the hedging transactions and the hedged items, as well as the Company\u2019s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets, non-current other assets, accrued liabilities or non-current other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2018, derivatives outstanding mature within 12 months or less. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of designated derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to general and administrative for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative for hedges of operating activity, or non-operating income (expense) for hedges of non-operating activity. See Note 9\u2014Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Non-derivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge. The Company designated the euro-denominated deferred cash consideration liability, a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the Company\u2019s euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe. Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to the change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the euro-denominated net investment, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. See Note 9\u2014Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management\u2019s best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 13\u2014Share-based Compensation . Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 12\u2014Earnings Per Share . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to the new revenue standard. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. The new standard will primarily impact the timing of recognition and classification of certain client incentives, including certain services provided as an incentive, and certain marketing-related funds paid to customers. The Company has completed an assessment of its existing customer contracts through September 30, 2018. Based on this assessment, application of the new standard to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2018 would not have resulted in a material impact. The impact of the new standard to future financial results is unknowable as it is not possible to estimate the impact of the standard to new customer contracts which may be executed in future periods. However, the new standard is not expected to have a material impact to the fiscal 2019 consolidated financial statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases in the statement of financial position. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2019 and does not anticipate that this new accounting guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated statement of operations. The Company estimates the value of leased assets and liabilities that may be recognized could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The actual impact will depend on the Company\u2019s lease portfolio at the time of adoption. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, which provides entities with an additional transition method to adopt the new leases standard. Under this new transition method, an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Consequently, an entity\u2019s reporting for the comparative periods presented in the financial statements will continue to be in ac"]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["Note 14\u2014Commitments and Contingencies Commitments.

The net aggregate proceeds from the Notes issued in 2017, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $2.5 billion . Use of Proceeds from Notes issued in 2017 . On September 11, 2017, the Company called for redemption of all of the $1.75 billion principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes in accordance with the optional redemption provisions set forth in the governing indenture. Subsequent to fiscal 2017, on October 11, 2017, the redemption date, the Company redeemed all of the $1.75 billion principal amount. The redemption was funded with the proceeds from the Notes issued in 2017. The indenture governing the Company\u2019s outstanding senior notes, or collectively, the \u201cNotes\u201d, contains customary event of default provisions. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equally and ratably among themselves and with the Company\u2019s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes are not secured by any assets of the Company and are not guaranteed by any of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries. The Company was in compliance with all related covenants as of September 30, 2018 . Each series of Notes may be redeemed as a whole or in part at the Company\u2019s option at any time at specified redemption prices.

We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nChanges in Accounting Principle \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers in fiscal year 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u2014(Continued) \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nAssessment of the accrued litigation liability for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement \n\nAs discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions , and has recorded an accrued litigation liability of $1,203 million as of September 30, 2019. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to assess the probability of loss associated with each legal proceeding and the amount of such loss, if any. The outcome of the legal proceedings to which the Company is a party is not within the complete control of the Company or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. \n\nWe identified the assessment of the accrued litigation liability for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement, also know as the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions, as a critical audit matter. This proceeding involves complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. The assessment of the accrued litigation liability for the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions required especially challenging auditor judgment due to the assumptions and estimates associated with the consideration and evaluation of possible outcomes. Changes to the outcomes could have a significant effect on the estimated amount of the liability. \n\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s litigation assessment process, including internal controls over the Company\u2019s litigation accrual process for the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions . We assessed the amounts accrued by reading letters received directly from the Company\u2019s external legal counsel and in-house legal counsel that discussed the Company\u2019s legal matters, including the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions . We considered relevant publicly available information, such as published news articles, about the Company and its legal matters, including the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions . We evaluated the Company\u2019s ability to estimate its monetary exposure by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon resolution of legal matters for merchants that opted out of the previous MDL class settlement. We assessed the Company\u2019s analysis of the estimated monetary exposure by checking that it included a complete population of opt-out merchants and performing sensitivity analysis over the Company\u2019s monetary exposure calculations. \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\u2014(Continued) \n\nEvaluation of the revenue recognition for incentive arrangements with certain strategic partners upon adoption of ASC Topic 606 \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants, and strategic partners for various programs. The determination of whether incentive payments to certain strategic partners should be recorded as an operating expense or a reduction to operating revenues is dependent upon the application of the consideration payable to a customer guidance within ASC Topic 606. \n\nWe identified the evaluation of the revenue recognition for incentive arrangements with certain strategic partners upon adoption of ASC Topic 606 as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the application of the consideration payable to customer guidance due to the unique nature and complexity of the Company\u2019s open-loop payment network. \n\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s revenue recognition process, including controls related to the accounting for incentive payments to strategic partners and the application of the consideration payable to a customer guidance. We evaluated a sample of arrangements with certain strategic partners that participate in the Company\u2019s open-loop payment network to understand the rights and obligations of the strategic partners, and how the Company earns revenue from and incentivizes the strategic partner. We selected a sample of certain strategic partner contracts and independently assessed the application of the consideration payable to a customer guidance, and compared our assessment to that of the Company\u2019s. \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2007. \n\nSanta Clara, California \n\nNovember 14, 2019 \n\nVISA INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS \n\n \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316119000050/v093019form10k.htm"}, "2017": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Note 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization . Visa Inc. (\"Visa\" or the \"Company\") is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (\"Visa U.S.A.\"), Visa International Service Association (\"Visa International\"), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (\"Visa Europe\"), Visa Canada Corporation (\"Visa Canada\"), Inovant LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world's largest retail electronic payments network \u2014 VisaNet \u2014 which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables us to provide its financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa's financial institution clients. On June 21, 2016, Visa acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. See Note 2\u2014Visa Europe . In February 2017, the Company completed a reorganization of Visa Europe and certain other legal entities to align the Company's corporate structure to the geographic jurisdictions in which it conducts business operations. Associated with this reorganization, the newly-formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc. shares held by Visa Europe that were previously recorded as treasury stock. See Note 18\u2014Income Taxes . Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company's investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. On March 18, 2015, the Company completed a four -for-one split of its class A common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are presented on a post-split basis. See Note 13\u2014Stockholders' Equity . The Company's activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. The Company revised certain fiscal 2016 amounts on the consolidated statements of cash flows to correct a presentation error in gross investing activity. Purchases and proceeds from maturities and sales of investment securities were each reduced by $17.6 billion , from $28.0 billion and $26.7 billion , respectively, to $10.4 billion and $9.1 billion , respectively. The previously reported amounts included purchases and sales of securities, using the proceeds of the Company's December 2015 debt offering, that had a maturity of 90 days or less. These securities are therefore considered cash and cash equivalents for financial reporting purposes and should not have been included in the gross investing activity. The correction did not affect the Company's total cash flows from investing activities, and there was no impact on the Company's financial position, total operating revenues, net income, or comprehensive income as of and for the periods presented. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. Restricted cash\u2014U.S. litigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 3\u2014U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 19\u2014Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 4\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The classification of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company\u2019s Level 1 assets include money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Level 2 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities include commercial paper, U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, corporate debt securities and foreign exchange derivative instruments. Level 3 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The Company did not have any Level 3 assets or liabilities at September 30, 2017 and 2016. Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company's operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Available-for-sale investment securities include investments in debt and equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. These investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities, which is recorded in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned and are included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt or equity security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Company\u2019s share of each entity\u2019s profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. The Company applies the cost method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entity\u2019s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash\u2014U.S. litigation escrow, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments, settlement risk guarantee, and derivative instruments. See Note 4\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the Company's financial institution clients are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa payment products are processed in accordance with the Company's rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets, excluding cash collateral held by Visa Europe as its clients retain beneficial ownership and the cash is only accessible to the Company in the event of default by the client on its settled obligations. Non-cash collateral assets are held on behalf of the Company by a third party and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10\u2014Settlement Guarantee Management . Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the asset\u2019s remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology's estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 5\u2014Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements, which may or may not contain lease incentives, is primarily recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2017 . See Note 6\u2014Intangible Assets and Goodwill . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and reacquired rights. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2017 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2017 . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment on February 1, 2017 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2017 . Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company's defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company's estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 19\u2014Legal Matters . Revenue recognition . The Company's operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, fees for account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Company's acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Prior to the acquisition of Visa Europe (see Note 2\u2014Visa Europe ), other revenues also included revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement. Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over Visa's network and drive innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established. The Company generally capitalizes advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. See Note 16\u2014Commitments and Contingencies . Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Company's income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 18\u2014Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Company\u2019s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a cash flow matching analysis, with the projected benefit payments matching spot rates from a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately 9 years for the U.S. plans and 11 years for the Visa Europe UK pension plan. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 9\u2014Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Company's functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations except for Visa Europe whose functional currency is the euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between the hedging transactions and the hedged items, as well as the Company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets, non-current other assets, accrued liabilities or non-current other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2017, derivatives outstanding mature within 12 months or less. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of designated derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to general and administrative for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective. Gains and losses resulting in changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative for hedges of operating activity, or non-operating income (expense) for hedges of non-operating activity. See Note 11\u2014Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Non-derivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge. The Company designated the euro-denominated deferred cash consideration liability, a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the Company's euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe. Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to the change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the euro-denominated net investment, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. See Note 11\u2014Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa rules. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and is described in Note 10\u2014Settlement Guarantee Management . Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management's best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 15\u2014Share-based Compensation . Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 14\u2014Earnings Per Share . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to the new revenue standard. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018, and expects to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective transition method. The Company expects that the new standard will primarily impact recognition timing for certain fixed incentives and price discounts provided to clients, and the classification of certain client incentives between contra revenues and operating expenses. The Company is still in the process of quantifying the full effect that ASU 2014-09 and all of its related subsequent updates will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, which requires a performance target in stock compensation awards that affects vesting, and is achievable after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2016. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, which provides guidance about a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The amendment will help entities evaluate whether s"]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["Note 16\u2014Commitments and Contingencies Commitments. The Company leases certain premises and equipment throughout the world with varying expiration dates. The Company incurred total rent expense of $159 million , $134 million and $136 million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Future minimum payments on leases, and marketing and sponsorship agreements per fiscal year, at September 30, 2017 , are as follows: 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Total (in millions) Operating leases $ 155 $ 119 $ 68 $ 64 $ 57 $ 163 $ 626 Marketing and sponsorships 124 123 112 40 33 \u2014 432 Total $ 279 $ 242 $ 180 $ 104 $ 90 $ 163 $ 1,058 Select sponsorship agreements require the Company to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For commitments where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, the Company has estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. In addition to the fixed payments stated above, select sponsorship agreements require the Company to undertake marketing, promotional or other activities up to stated monetary values to support events which the Company is sponsoring. The stated monetary value of these activities typically represents the value in the marketplace, which may be significantly higher than the actual costs incurred by the Company. Client incentives. The Company has agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions. These agreements, with terms ranging from one year to sixteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Client incentives are recognized primarily as a reduction to operating revenue in the period the related volumes and transactions occur, based on management's estimate of the client's performance in accordance with the terms of the incentive agreement. The agreements may or may not limit the amount of client incentive payments. The table below sets forth the estimated expected future reduction of revenue per fiscal year for client incentive agreements in effect at September 30, 2017 : (in millions) 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Total Client incentives $ 5,049 $ 4,654 $ 4,117 $ 3,658 $ 3,102 $ 5,080 $ 25,660 The amount of client incentives that will be recorded as a reduction of revenue in future periods under the Company's incentive agreements is unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume, and will likely change materially from the estimates above due to changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Increases in client incentive payments are generally driven by increases in payment and transaction volume and hence, an associated increase in revenue. As a result, in the event client incentives exceed the above estimates, it is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Deferred purchase consideration. On June 21, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, the Company will pay an additional \u20ac1.0 billion , plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the Closing.

Interest on the Notes issued in 2017 is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing March 15, 2018. The net aggregate proceeds from the Notes issued in 2017, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $2.5 billion . Use of Proceeds from Notes issued in 2017 . On September 11, 2017, the Company called for redemption of all of the $1.75 billion principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes in accordance with the optional redemption provisions set forth in the governing indenture. Subsequent to fiscal 2017, on October 11, 2017, the redemption date, the Company redeemed all of the $1.75 billion principal amount. The redemption was funded with the proceeds from the Notes issued in 2017. In December 2015, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes (the 2017 Notes, 2020 Notes, December 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2035 Notes and 2045 Notes, or collectively, the \"Notes issued in 2015\") in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion , with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Interest on the Notes issued in 2015 is payable semi-annually. The net aggregate proceeds from the Notes issued in 2015, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were $15.9 billion . The discounts and debt issuance costs are amortized over the respective term of each note using the effective interest method. The indenture governing the Notes issued in 2017 and the Notes issued in 2015, or collectively, the \"Notes\", contains customary event of default provisions. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equally and ratably among themselves and with the Company's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes are not secured by any assets of the Company and are not guaranteed by any of the Company's subsidiaries. The Company was in compliance with all related covenants as of September 30, 2017 . The Company recognized related interest expense of $505 million and $399 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , respectively, as non-operating expense.

During fiscal 2017 , the Company issued $567 million of commercial paper, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.79% , and subsequently repaid its outstanding obligation. The Company had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2017 . Credit Facility The Company is a party to a credit agreement for a 5 -year, unsecured $4.0 billion revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\") that was entered into on January 27, 2016.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2007. \n\nSanta Clara, California \n\nNovember 16, 2018 \n\n 55 \n\nVISA INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS \n\n \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316118000055/v093018.htm"}, "2016": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Note 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization . In a series of transactions from October 1 to October 3, 2007, Visa Inc. (Visa or the Company) undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa U.S.A.), Visa International Service Association (Visa International), Visa Canada Corporation (Visa Canada) and Inovant LLC (Inovant) became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa and established the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan (the October 2007 reorganization or reorganization). See Note 3\u2014U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The reorganization was reflected as a single transaction on October 1, 2007 using the purchase method of accounting with Visa U.S.A. as the accounting acquirer. Visa Europe Limited (Visa Europe) did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., but rather remained owned and governed by its European member financial institutions. On June 21, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. The Company's consolidated statements of operations do not reflect the financial results of Visa Europe for the 10 days from the acquisition date through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. See Note 2\u2014Acquisition of Visa Europe . Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited (VWPL), Visa Europe Limited (Visa Europe), Visa Canada, Inovant and CyberSource Corporation (CyberSource), operate one of the world's largest retail electronic payments network \u2014 VisaNet \u2014 which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa's financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company's investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. On March 18, 2015, the Company completed a four -for-one split of its class A common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are presented on a post-split basis. See Note 14\u2014Stockholders' Equity . The Company's activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. Restricted cash\u2014U.S. litigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 3\u2014U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20\u2014Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 4\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The classification of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company\u2019s Level 1 assets include money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Level 2 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities include commercial paper, U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, corporate debt securities and foreign exchange derivative instruments. Level 3 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities included auction rate securities and the Visa Europe put option at September 30, 2015. Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company's operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Available-for-sale investment securities include investments in debt and equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. These investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities, which is recorded in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned and are included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt or equity security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Company\u2019s share of each entity\u2019s profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. The Company applies the cost method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entity\u2019s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash-U.S. litigation escrow, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments, settlement risk guarantee, and derivative instruments. See Note 4\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the Company's financial institution clients are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients.These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa payment products are processed in accordance with the Company's rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets, excluding cash collateral held by Visa Europe as its clients retain beneficial ownership and the cash is only accessible to the Company in the event of default by the client on its settled obligations. Non-cash collateral assets are held on behalf of the Company by a third party and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11\u2014Settlement Guarantee Management . Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the asset\u2019s remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology's estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 6\u2014Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements, which may or may not contain lease incentives, is primarily recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2016 . See Note 7\u2014Intangible Assets and Goodwill . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and reacquired rights. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2016 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2016 . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment on February 1, 2016 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2016 . Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company's defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company's estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 20\u2014Legal Matters . Revenue recognition . The Company's operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement (see Note 2\u2014Acquisition of Visa Europe ) prior to the acquisition of Visa Europe, fees for account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Company's acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over Visa's network and drive innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established. The Company generally capitalizes advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. See Note 17\u2014Commitments and Contingencies . Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Company's income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 19\u2014Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Company\u2019s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a cash flow matching analysis, with the projected benefit payments matching spot rates from a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately 9 years for the U.S. plans and 12 years for the Visa Europe U.K. pension plan. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 10\u2014Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Company's functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations except for Visa Europe whose functional currency is the euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2016, derivatives outstanding mature within 18 months or less. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of designated derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to general and administrative for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective. Gains and losses resulting in changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative for hedges of operating activity, or non-operating income (expense) for hedges of non-operating activity. See Note 12\u2014Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Non-derivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge. The Company designated the euro-denominated deferred cash consideration liability, a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the Company's euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe. See Note 2\u2014Acquisition of Visa Europe . Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to the change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the euro-denominated net investment, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. See Note 12\u2014Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments . Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa Rules. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and is described in Note 11\u2014Settlement Guarantee Management . Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management's best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 16\u2014Share-based Compensation . Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 15\u2014Earnings Per Share . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations under the new revenue recognition standard. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, which clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying promised goods or services and on determining whether an entity's promise to grant a license with either a right to use the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, which rescinds certain SEC staff observer comments upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, including the SEC comments related to consideration given by a vendor to a customer. In May 2016, the FASB also issued ASU 2016-12, which provides narrow scope improvements and technical expedients on assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, evaluating contract modifications and completed contracts at the time of transition and the disclosure requirement for the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption.The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is evaluating the full effect that ASU 2014-09 and all of its related subsequent updates will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, which requires a performance target in stock compensation awards that affects vesting, and is achievable after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Future minimum payments on leases, and marketing and sponsorship agreements per fiscal year, at September 30, 2016 , are as follows: 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Total (in millions) Operating leases $ 126 $ 103 $ 82 $ 61 $ 57 $ 190 $ 619 Marketing and sponsorships 126 128 120 110 38 33 555 Total $ 252 $ 231 $ 202 $ 171 $ 95 $ 223 $ 1,174 Select sponsorship agreements require the Company to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For commitments where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, the Company has estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. In addition to the fixed payments stated above, select sponsorship agreements require the Company to undertake marketing, promotional or other activities up to stated monetary values to support events which the Company is sponsoring. The stated monetary value of these activities typically represents the value in the marketplace, which may be significantly higher than the actual costs incurred by the Company. Client incentives. The Company has agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions. These agreements, with terms ranging from one year to sixteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. These agreements are designed to encourage client business and to increase overall Visa- payment and transaction volume, thereby reducing per-unit transaction processing costs and increasing brand awareness for all Visa clients. Payments made that qualify for capitalization and obligations incurred under these programs are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Client incentives are recognized primarily as a reduction to operating revenue in the period the related volumes and transactions occur, based on management's estimate of the client's performance in accordance with the terms of the incentive agreement. The agreements may or may not limit the amount of client incentive payments. The table below sets forth the expected future reduction of revenue per fiscal year for client incentive agreements in effect at September 30, 2016 : (in millions) 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Total Client incentives $ 4,211 $ 3,752 $ 3,211 $ 2,628 $ 2,245 $ 4,617 $ 20,664 The amount of client incentives recorded as a reduction of revenue in future periods under the Company's incentive arrangements, will be greater or less than the estimates above due to changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Based on these agreements, increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, and as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed the above estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We also have audited Visa Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 , based on Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Visa Inc.\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2017  and 2016 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2017 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Visa Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 , based on Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nSanta Clara, California \n\nNovember 16, 2017   \n\n 53 \n\nVISA INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS \n\n \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316117000044/v093017.htm"}, "2015": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Note 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization . In a series of transactions from October 1 to October 3, 2007, Visa Inc. (\"Visa\" or the \"Company\") undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A. Inc. (\"Visa U.S.A.\"), Visa International Service Association (\"Visa International\"), Visa Canada Corporation (\"Visa Canada\") and Inovant LLC (\"Inovant\") became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa and established the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan (the \"October 2007 reorganization\" or \"reorganization\"). See Note 3\u2014U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities . The reorganization was reflected as a single transaction on October 1, 2007 using the purchase method of accounting with Visa U.S.A. as the accounting acquirer. Visa Europe Limited (\"Visa Europe\") did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., but rather remained owned and governed by its European member financial institutions. See Note 2\u2014Visa Europe . Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited (\u201cVWPL\u201d), Visa Canada, Inovant and CyberSource Corporation (\u201cCyberSource\u201d), operate one of the world's most advanced processing networks \u2014 VisaNet \u2014 which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions worldwide. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa-branded cards and payment products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa's financial institution clients. Visa provides a wide variety of payment solutions that support payment products that issuers can offer to their account holders: pay now with debit, pay ahead with prepaid or pay later with credit products. These services facilitate transactions on Visa's network among account holders, merchants, financial institutions and governments in mature and emerging markets globally. Consolidation and basis of presentation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company's investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. On March 18, 2015, the Company completed a four -for-one split of its class A common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. All per share amounts and number of shares outstanding in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are presented on a post-split basis. See Note 14\u2014Stockholders' Equity . Beginning in fiscal 2015, current income tax receivable is included in the prepaid expenses and other current assets line. Previously, it had been presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets. All prior period amounts within the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. The reclassification did not affect the Company's financial position, total operating revenues, net income, comprehensive income, or cash flows as of and for the periods presented. The Company's activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services. Use of estimates . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate. Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. Restricted cash\u2014litigation escrow . The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 3\u2014U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities and Note 20\u2014Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Investments and fair value. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 4\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments . The classification of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company\u2019s Level 1 assets include money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Level 2 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology can include: (1) quoted prices in active markets for similar (not identical) assets or liabilities; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 2 assets and liabilities include commercial paper, U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, corporate debt securities and foreign exchange derivative instruments. Level 3 \u2014Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities include auction rate securities and the Visa Europe put option. Trading investment securities include mutual fund equity security investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans. Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company's employees. These investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company's operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend income and changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income, and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Available-for-sale investment securities include investments in debt and equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. The majority of these investments are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities, which is recorded in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned and are included in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt or equity security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company has not presented required separate disclosures because its gross unrealized loss positions in debt or equity securities for the periods presented are not material. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Company\u2019s share of each entity\u2019s profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether the Company has significant influence over the investees. The Company applies the cost method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the cost and equity methods for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entity\u2019s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model. Financial instruments . The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash-litigation escrow, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments, settlement risk guarantee, derivative instruments, and the Visa Europe put option. See Note 4\u2014Fair Value Measurements and Investments . Settlement receivable and payable . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. U.S. dollar settlements with the Company's financial institution clients are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlement in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Customer collateral . The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa-branded cards and payment products processed in accordance with the Company's rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-cash collateral assets are held on behalf of the Company by a third party and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11\u2014Settlement Guarantee Management . Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over Visa's network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established. The Company generally capitalizes advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. See Note 17\u2014Commitments and Contingencies . Property, equipment and technology, net . Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 7 years. Capital leases are amortized over the lease term and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the asset\u2019s remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and technology, net, until removed from service. Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology's estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 6\u2014Property, Equipment and Technology, Net . Leases . The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises, software and equipment. Rent expense related to operating lease agreements, which may or may not contain lease incentives, is primarily recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Intangible assets, net . The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2015 . See Note 7\u2014Intangible Assets and Goodwill . Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and the Visa Europe franchise right acquired in the October 2007 reorganization. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. The Company completed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2015 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2015 . Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of February 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment on February 1, 2015 , and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2015 . Accrued litigation . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company's defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company's estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 20\u2014Legal Matters . Revenue recognition . The Company's operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement (see Note 2\u2014Visa Europe ), fees from account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Company's acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Income taxes . The Company's income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 19\u2014Income Taxes . Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . The Company\u2019s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a \"bond duration matching\" methodology, which reflects the matching of projected plan obligation cash flows to an average of high-quality corporate bond yield curves whose duration matches the projected cash flows. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately 9 years for plans in the United States. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See Note 10\u2014Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits . Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . The Company's functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. For certain foreign operations, the Company's functional currency may be the local currency in which a foreign subsidiary executes its business transactions. Translation from the local currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative financial instruments . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2015, derivatives outstanding mature within 12 months or less. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations (in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to general and administrative for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective) depending on whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting. Fair value represents the difference in the value of the derivative instruments at the contractual rate and the value at current market rates, and generally reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on broker quotes for the same or similar instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. See Note 12\u2014Derivative Financial Instruments . Guarantees and indemnifications . The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa Rules. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and is described in Note 11\u2014Settlement Guarantee Management . The Company indemnifies Visa Europe for claims arising from the Company\u2019s or Visa Europe\u2019s activities that are brought outside of Visa Europe\u2019s region, as described in Note 2\u2014Visa Europe . Share-based compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management's best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 16\u2014Share-based Compensation . Earnings per share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 15\u2014Earnings Per Share . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2013-04, which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, which clarifies the applicable guidance for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity, or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, which provides guidance for the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2014. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018.The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

The Company leases certain premises and equipment throughout the world with varying expiration dates. The Company incurred total rent expense of $136 million , $134 million and $94 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

For commitments where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, the Company has estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. In addition to the fixed payments stated above, select sponsorship agreements require the Company to undertake marketing, promotional or other activities up to stated monetary values to support events which the Company is sponsoring. The stated monetary value of these activities typically represents the value in the marketplace, which may be significantly higher than the actual costs incurred by the Company. Client incentives. The Company has agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions. These agreements, with terms ranging from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. These agreements are designed to encourage client business and to increase overall Visa-branded payment and transaction volume, thereby reducing per-unit transaction processing costs and increasing brand awareness for all Visa clients. Payments made that qualify for capitalization, and obligations incurred under these programs are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet. Client incentives are recognized primarily as a reduction to operating revenue in the period the related volumes and transactions occur, based on management's estimate of the client's performance in accordance with the terms of the incentive agreement. The agreements may or may not limit the amount of client incentive payments. The table below sets forth the expected future reduction of revenue per fiscal year for client incentive agreements in effect at September 30, 2015 : (in millions) 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Total Client incentives $ 3,237 $ 3,130 $ 2,670 $ 2,205 $ 1,610 $ 3,965 $ 16,817 The amount of client incentives recorded as a reduction of revenue in future periods under the Company's incentive arrangements, will be greater or less than the estimates above due to changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Based on these agreements, increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, and as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed the above estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows."]}, "Debt": {"Debt": ["Note 9\u2014Debt Commercial paper program.

Refer to Note 24 for additional discussion of the products and services that comprise each segment. Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. We consolidate entities in which we hold a \u201ccontrolling financial interest.\u201d For voting interest entities, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest when we are able to exercise control over the investees\u2019 operating and financial decisions. For variable interest entities (VIEs), the determination of which is based on the amount and characteristics of the entity\u2019s equity, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the party that has both: (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact that VIE\u2019s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb the losses of, or the right to receive the benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to that VIE. Entities in which our voting interest in common equity does not provide it with control, but allows us to exert significant influence over operating and financial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method. We also have investments in equity securities where our voting interest is below the level of significant influence, including investments that we make in non-public companies in the ordinary course of business. Such investments are initially recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value through earnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar instruments of the same company or if they are determined to be impaired. See Note 4 for the accounting policy for our marketable equity securities. FOREIGN CURRENCY Transactions conducted in currencies other than the applicable functional currency of an entity are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At the period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using period end rates. The resulting transaction gains and losses are recorded in Other, net expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, the monetary assets and liabilities and results of operations are translated for consolidation purposes into U.S. dollars at period-end rates for monetary assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results of operations. The resulting translation adjustments, along with any related qualifying hedge and tax effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), a component of shareholders\u2019 equity. Translation adjustments, including qualifying hedge and tax effects, are reclassified to earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of investments in foreign operations. AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Accounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management\u2019s assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. INCOME STATEMENT Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customers are satisfied. We are not required to disclose revenue that is expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g., discount revenue). Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to all other contracts with customers is not material. Discount Revenue Discount revenue represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant\u2019s overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. Discount revenue is generally recorded at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. Card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and mid-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three In cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our network partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. Net Card Fees Net card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Service Fees and Other Revenue Service fees and other revenue includes service fees earned from merchants and other customers and travel commissions and fees, which are generally recognized in the period when the service is performed, and delinquency and foreign currency-related fees, which are primarily recognized in the period when they are charged to the Card Member. In addition, Service fees and other revenue includes income (losses) from our investments in which we have significant influence and therefore account for under the equity method. Refer to Note 18 for additional information. Processed Revenue Processed revenue primarily represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we settle with merchants and our third-party merchant acquirers on behalf of our network card issuing partners. The amount of fees charged for accepting American Express-branded cards is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant or third-party merchant acquirer and recorded as Processed revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. Our network card issuing partners receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as contra-revenue within Processed revenue to the extent that there is revenue from the same customer, after which any additional issuer rate is recorded as expense in Business development. Processed revenue also includes fees related to alternative payment solutions, which are generally recognized when the service is performed. Contra-revenue Payments made pursuant to contractual arrangements with our merchants, network partners, and other customers are classified as contra-revenue, except where we receive goods, services or other benefits for which the fair value is determinable and measurable, in which case they are recorded as expense. Interest Income Interest on Card Member loans is assessed using the average daily balance method. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding, in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement, until the outstanding balance is paid, or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relate to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on the investment security\u2019s outstanding balance. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess of near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Interest Expense Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as the realized impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk on our long-term debt. Card Member Rewards We issue charge and credit cards that allow Card Members to participate in various rewards programs (e.g., Membership Rewards, cash back and cobrand). Rewards expense is recognized in the period Card Members earn rewards, generally by spending on their enrolled card products. For Membership Rewards and cash back, we record a liability that represents the rewards that are expected to be redeemed, as well as, for Membership Rewards, the estimated cost of points earned. For cobrand, we record a liability based primarily on rewards earned on Card Member spending on cobrand cards, and make associated payments to our cobrand partners. The partner is liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner\u2019s own loyalty program. Card Member rewards liabilities are impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. Changes in the Card Member rewards liabilities during the period are taken as an increase or decrease to the Card Member rewards expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Business Development Business development expense includes payments to our cobrand partners, corporate client incentive payments earned on achievement of pre-set targets and certain payments to network partners. These costs are generally expensed as incurred. Card Member Services Card Member services expense represents costs incurred in providing our Card Members with various value-added benefits and services, which are generally expensed as incurred. Marketing Marketing expense includes costs incurred in the development and initial placement of advertising, which are expensed in the period in which the advertising first takes place. All other marketing expenses are generally expensed as incurred. BALANCE SHEET Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank balances, including securities purchased under resale agreements, restricted cash, and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Restricted cash primarily represents amounts related to Card Member credit balances as well as upcoming debt maturities of consolidated VIEs. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We allocate goodwill to our reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business that is one level below an operating segment, for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by the operating segment manager. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting units below its carrying value. Prior to completing the assessment of goodwill for impairment, we also perform a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Alternatively, we can perform a more detailed quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. This qualitative assessment entails the evaluation of factors such as economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using the quantitative assessment. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount over and above the reporting unit's fair value. When measuring the fair value of our reporting units in the quantitative assessment, we use widely accepted valuation techniques, applying a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples). When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we use internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. To discount these cash flows, we use the expected cost of equity, determined by using a capital asset pricing model. We believe the discount rates appropriately reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally-developed forecasts. When using market multiples under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies\u2019 multiples (e.g., earnings or revenues) to our reporting units\u2019 operating results. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we performed a qualitative assessment in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for those reporting units which were impacted by the realignment of our operating segments and concluded that their fair values exceeded their carrying values. Refer to Note 24 for further information on the realignment of our operating segments. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred during construction are capitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years for equipment, furniture and building improvements, and from 40 to 50 years for premises, which are depreciated based upon their estimated useful life at the acquisition date. Certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software are also capitalized and recorded in Premises and equipment. Once the specific software feature is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software\u2019s estimated useful life, generally 5 years. We review these assets for impairment using the same impairment methodology used for our intangible assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility, or the economic life of the improvement, and range from 5 to 10 years. We recognize lease restoration obligations at the fair value of the restoration liabilities when incurred and amortize the restoration assets over the lease term. Leases We have operating leases worldwide for facilities and equipment, which, for those leases with terms greater than 12 months, are recorded as lease-related assets and liabilities. We do not separate lease and non-lease components. Lease-related assets, or right-of-use assets, are recognized at the lease commencement date at amounts equal to the respective lease liabilities, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, initial direct costs and lease incentives. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the contractual fixed lease payments, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date or upon modification of the lease. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.

RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting guidance on troubled debt restructuring (TDR) and write-offs, effective January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The amendments eliminate the existing TDR guidance for those entities that have adopted Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, create a single loan modification accounting model and enhance disclosure requirements for loan modifications and write-offs. Beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2023, our financial statements will reflect the adoption of this standard on a prospective basis. The updated guidance will not have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted the new credit reserving methodology, applicable to certain financial instruments, known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology resulting in an increase in the reserves for total loans and receivables credit losses on adoption, which was recorded under a modified retrospective transition with an offset to the opening balance of retained earnings. Refer to Note 3 for how management estimates reserves for credit losses in accordance with the CECL methodology."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": {"Debt": ["DEBT SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS Our short-term borrowings outstanding, defined as borrowings with original contractual maturity dates of less than one year, as of December 31 were as follows: 2022 2021 (Millions, except percentages) Outstanding Balance Year-End Stated Interest Rate on Debt (a) Outstanding Balance Year-End Stated Interest Rate on Debt (a) Short-term borrowings (b) $ 1,348 0.94 % $ 2,243 0.58 % Total $ 1,348 0.94 % $ 2,243 0.58 % (a) For floating-rate issuances, the stated interest rates are weighted based on the outstanding principal balances and interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nChange in Accounting Principle \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nReserves for Credit Losses on Card Member Loans \n\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans represent management\u2019s estimate of the expected credit losses in the Company\u2019s outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans as of the balance sheet date. The reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans was $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2022. Management estimates lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period) beyond the balance sheet date. As disclosed by management, in estimating expected credit losses, management uses a combination of statistically-based models that entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of the Company\u2019s reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. Management uses these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan balances to produce its reserves for expected credit losses. Within the R&S Period, the Company\u2019s models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. Beyond the R&S Period, expected credit losses are estimated by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. Management also estimates the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off loans considering how long ago the loan was written off and future economic conditions. Additionally, management evaluates whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs, qualitative reserves, and significant assumptions, including the R&S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for estimating the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans through (i) evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and significant assumptions used to estimate the reserves. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s methodology and the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and certain significant assumptions, including the R&S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period. \n\nMembership Rewards Liability \n\nAs described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Membership Rewards liability represents management\u2019s estimate of the cost of Membership Rewards points earned that are expected to be redeemed in the future. The Membership Rewards liability was $12.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. As disclosed by management, the URR assumption is used by management to estimate the number of points earned that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Membership Rewards liability is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the URR involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs and assumptions used by management and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the estimate of the Membership Rewards liability, including the URR and WAC assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs to the statistical and actuarial models used to estimate the URR assumption, including redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, and card spend levels, (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of the URR assumption and comparing the independent estimate to management\u2019s assumption to evaluate its reasonableness and (iii) comparing our independently calculated Membership Rewards liability to management\u2019s estimate. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nNew York, New York \n\nFebruary 10, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2005. \n\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  \n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nPAGE \n\nConsolidated Statements of Income \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 20 2 2 , 20 2 1 and 20 20 \n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 20 2 2 , 20 2 1 and 20 20 \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \u2013 December 31, 20 2 2 and 20 21 \n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 20 2 2 , 20 2 1 and 20 20 \n\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders\u2019 Equity \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 202 2 , 202 1 and 20 20 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nNote 2 \u2013 Loans and Card Member Receivables \n\nNote 3 \u2013 Reserves for Credit Losses \n\nNote 4 \u2013 Investment Securities \n\nNote 5 \u2013 Asset Securitizations \n\nNote 6 \u2013 Other Assets \n\nNote 7 \u2013 Customer Deposits \n\nNote 8 \u2013 Debt \n\nNote 9 \u2013 Other Liabilities \n\nNote 1 0 \u2013 Stock -Based Compensation \n\nNote 1 1 \u2013 Retirement Plans \n\nNote 1 2 \u2013 Contingencies and Commitments \n\nNote 1 3 \u2013 Derivatives and Hedging Activities \n\nNote 1 4 \u2013 Fair Values \n\nNote 1 5 \u2013 Guarantees \n\nNote 1 6 \u2013 Common and Preferred Shares \n\nNote 17 \u2013 Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) \n\nNote 18 \u2013 Service Fees and Other Revenue and Other Expenses \n\nNote 19 \u2013 Restructuring \n\nNote 2 0 \u2013 Income Taxes \n\nNote 21 \u2013 Earnings Per Common Share (EPS) \n\nNote 2 2 \u2013 Regulatory Matters and Capital Adequacy \n\nNote 2 3 \u2013 Significant Credit Concentrations \n\nNote 2 4 \u2013 Reportable Operating Segments and Geographic Operations \n\nNote 2 5 \u2013 Parent Company \n\n\n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME  \n\nYear Ended December 31 (Millions, except per share amounts) \n\n2022 2021 2020 Revenues Non-interest revenues Discount revenue $ 30,739 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496223000006/axp-20221231.htm"}, "2021": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES THE C OMPANY We are a globally integrated payments company that provides our customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success.

For variable interest entities (VIEs), the determination of which is based on the amount and characteristics of the entity\u2019s equity, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the party that has both: (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact that VIE\u2019s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb the losses of, or the right to receive the benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to that VIE. Entities in which our voting interest in common equity does not provide it with control, but allows us to exert significant influence over operating and financial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method. We also have investments in equity securities where our voting interest is below the level of significant influence, including investments that we make in non-public companies in the ordinary course of business. Such investments are initially recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value through earnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar transactions of the same company or if they are determined to be impaired. See Note 4 for the accounting policy for our marketable equity securities. FOREIGN CURRENCY Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period; non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historic exchange rate at the date of the transaction; revenues and expenses are translated at the average month-end exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments, along with any related qualifying hedge and tax effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), a component of shareholders\u2019 equity. Translation adjustments, including qualifying hedge and tax effects, are reclassified to earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of investments in foreign operations. Gains and losses related to transactions in a currency other than the functional currency are reported in Other, net expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Accounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management\u2019s assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. INCOME STATEMENT Discount Revenue Discount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant\u2019s overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. The card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three In cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue. Revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material. Net Card Fees Net card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Effective April 1, 2021, we prospectively changed the recognition of certain costs paid to a third party previously recognized over the twelve month card membership period in Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income; such costs are now recorded as incurred in Marketing and business development expense. This change is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Fees and Commissions Other fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged. Refer to Note 18 for additional information. Contra-revenue Payments made pursuant to contractual arrangements with our merchants, GNS partners, and other customers are classified as contra-revenue, except where we receive goods, services or other benefits for which the fair value is determinable and measurable, in which case they are recorded as expense. Interest Income Interest on Card Member loans is assessed using the average daily balance method. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding, in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement, until the outstanding balance is paid, or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relate to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on the investment security\u2019s outstanding balance. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess of near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Interest Expense Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as the realized impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk on our long-term debt. Marketing and Business Development Marketing and business development expense includes costs incurred in the development and initial placement of advertising, which are expensed in the year in which the advertising first takes place. Also included in Marketing and business development expense are payments to our cobrand partners, Card Member statement credits and promotional rewards-based incentives for qualifying charges on eligible card accounts, corporate client incentive payments earned on achievement of pre-set targets, and certain payments to GNS partners. These costs are generally expensed as incurred. Card Member Rewards We issue charge and credit cards that allow Card Members to participate in various rewards programs (e.g., Membership Rewards, cash back and cobrand). Rewards expense is recognized in the period Card Members earn rewards, generally by spending on their enrolled card products. For Membership Rewards and cash back, we record a liability that represents the rewards that are expected to be redeemed, as well as, for Membership Rewards, the estimated cost of points earned. For cobrand, we record a liability based primarily on rewards earned on Card Member spending on cobrand cards, and make associated payments to our cobrand partners. The partner is liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner\u2019s own loyalty program. Card Member rewards liabilities are impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. Changes in the Card Member rewards liabilities during the period are taken as an increase or decrease to the Card Member rewards expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. BALANCE SHEET Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank balances, including securities purchased under resale agreements, restricted cash, and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Restricted cash primarily represents amounts related to Card Member credit balances as well as upcoming debt maturities of consolidated VIEs. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We allocate goodwill to our reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business that is one level below an operating segment, for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by the operating segment manager. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting units below its carrying value. Prior to completing the assessment of goodwill for impairment, we also perform a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Alternatively, we can perform a more detailed quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. This qualitative assessment entails the evaluation of factors such as economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using the quantitative assessment. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount over and above the reporting unit's fair value. When measuring the fair value of our reporting units in the quantitative assessment, we use widely accepted valuation techniques, applying a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples). When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we use internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. To discount these cash flows, we use the expected cost of equity, determined by using a capital asset pricing model. We believe the discount rates appropriately reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally-developed forecasts. When using market multiples under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies\u2019 multiples (e.g., earnings or revenues) to our reporting units\u2019 actual results. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred during construction are capitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years for equipment, furniture and building improvements, and from 40 to 50 years for premises, which are depreciated based upon their estimated useful life at the acquisition date. Certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software are also capitalized and recorded in Premises and equipment. Once the specific software feature is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software\u2019s estimated useful life, generally 5 years. We review these assets for impairment using the same impairment methodology used for our intangible assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility, or the economic life of the improvement, and range from 5 to 10 years. We recognize lease restoration obligations at the fair value of the restoration liabilities when incurred and amortize the restoration assets over the lease term. Leases We have operating leases worldwide for facilities and equipment, which, for those leases with terms greater than 12 months, are recorded as lease-related assets and liabilities. We do not separate lease and non-lease components. Lease-related assets, or right-of-use assets, are recognized at the lease commencement date at amounts equal to the respective lease liabilities, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, initial direct costs and lease incentives. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the contractual fixed lease payments, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date or upon modification of the lease. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Effective January 1, 2021, we elected to change our accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing (QAH) projects from the equity method of accounting to the proportional amortization method (PAM) in accordance with the accounting guidance. PAM results in the amortization of the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the related tax credits, and recognition of the net investment performance in the statement of income as a component of Income tax provision, while the equity method reflected losses related to the investments as a component of Other, net expenses. As a result, we believe PAM is preferable as it better reflects the economics of our tax credit investments. Since the impact of this change is immaterial to our prior and current year financial statements, we implemented PAM on a prospective basis which resulted in a one-time charge to Income tax provision of $55 million in the first quarter of 2021, reflecting the cumulative impact of the difference in the timing of expense recognition between the equity method and PAM. Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted the new credit reserving methodology, applicable to certain financial instruments, known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology resulting in an increase in the reserves for total loans and receivables credit losses on adoption, which was recorded under a modified retrospective transition with an offset to the opening balance of retained earnings. Refer to Note 3 for additional information on impact of adoption and how management estimates reserves for credit losses in accordance with the CECL methodology."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": {"Debt": ["DEBT SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS Our short-term borrowings outstanding, defined as borrowings with original contractual maturity dates of less than one year, as of December 31 were as follows: 2021 2020 (Millions, except percentages) Outstanding Balance Year-End Stated Interest Rate on Debt (a) Outstanding Balance Year-End Stated Interest Rate on Debt (a) Commercial paper (b) $ \u2014 \u2014 % $ \u2014 \u2014 % Other short-term borrowings (c) 2,243 0.58 1,878 0.61 Total $ 2,243 0.58 % $ 1,878 0.61 % (a) For floating-rate issuances, the stated interest rates are weighted based on the outstanding principal balances and interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nChange in Accounting Principle \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nReserves for Credit Losses on Card Member Loans \n\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans represent management\u2019s estimate of the expected credit losses in the Company\u2019s outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans as of the balance sheet date. The reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans was $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. Management estimates lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period) beyond the balance sheet date. As disclosed by management, in estimating expected credit losses, management uses a combination of statistically-based models that entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of the Company\u2019s reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. Management uses these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan balances to produce its reserves for expected credit losses. Within the R&S Period, the Company\u2019s models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. Beyond the R&S Period, expected credit losses are estimated by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. Management also estimates the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off loans considering how long ago the loan was written off and future economic conditions. Additionally, management evaluates whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs, qualitative reserves, and significant assumptions, including the R&S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for estimating the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans through (i) evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and significant assumptions used to estimate the reserves. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s methodology and the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and certain significant assumptions, including the R&S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nMembership Rewards Liability \n\nAs described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Membership Rewards liability represents management\u2019s estimate of the cost of Membership Rewards points earned that are expected to be redeemed in the future. The Membership Rewards liability was $11.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. As disclosed by management, the URR assumption is used by management to estimate the number of points earned that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Membership Rewards liability is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the URR involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs and assumptions used by management, (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge and (iii) the estimate of the WAC involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the methodology. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the estimate of the Membership Rewards liability, including the URR and WAC assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs to the statistical and actuarial models used to estimate the URR assumption, including redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, and card spend levels, (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of the URR assumption and comparing the independent estimate to management\u2019s assumption to evaluate its reasonableness, (iii) evaluating management\u2019s methodology for determining the WAC assumption and (iv) comparing our independently calculated Membership Rewards liability to management\u2019s estimate. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nNew York, New York \n\nFebruary 11, 2022 \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2005. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n \n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nPAGE \n\nConsolidated Statements of Income \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 20 2 1 , 20 20 and 201 9 \n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 20 2 1 , 20 20 and 201 9 \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \u2013 December 31, 20 2 1 and 20 20 \n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 20 2 1 , 20 20 and 201 9 \n\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders\u2019 Equity \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 20 2 1 , 20 20 and 20 20 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nNote 2 \u2013 Loans and Card Member Receivables \n\nNote 3 \u2013 Reserves for Credit Losses \n\nNote 4 \u2013 Investment Securities \n\nNote 5 \u2013 Asset Securitizations \n\nNote 6 \u2013 Other Assets \n\nNote 7 \u2013 Customer Deposits \n\nNote 8 \u2013 Debt \n\nNote 9 \u2013 Other Liabilities \n\nNote 1 0 \u2013 Stock Plans \n\nNote 1 1 \u2013 Retirement Plans \n\nNote 1 2 \u2013 Contingencies and Commitments \n\nNote 1 3 \u2013 Derivatives and Hedging Activities \n\nNote 1 4 \u2013 Fair Values \n\nNote 1 5 \u2013 Guarantees \n\nNote 1 6 \u2013 Common and Preferred Shares \n\nNote 1 7 \u2013 Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) \n\nNote 18 \u2013 Other Fees and Commissions and Other Expenses \n\nNote 19 \u2013 Restructuring \n\nNote 2 0 \u2013 Income Taxes \n\nNote 2 1 \u2013 Earnings Per Common Share (EPS) \n\nNote 2 2 \u2013 Regulatory Matters and Capital Adequacy \n\nNote 2 3 \u2013 Significant Credit Concentrations \n\nNote 2 4 \u2013 Reportable Operating Segments and Geographic Operations \n\nNote 2 5 \u2013 Parent Company \n\n\n\nTable of Contents \n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME \n\n \n\nYear Ended December 31 (Millions, except per share amounts) \n\n2021 2020 2019 Revenues Non-interest revenues Discount revenue $ 25,727 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496222000008/axp-20211231.htm"}, "2020": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES THE C OMPANY We are a globally integrated payments company that provides our customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our principal products and services are credit and charge card products, along with travel and lifestyle related services, offered to consumers and businesses around the world. Business travel-related services are offered through the non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Business Travel.

These products and services are sold through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party vendors and business partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams, and direct response advertising. Refer to Note 24 for additional discussion of the products and services that comprise each segment. Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. We consolidate entities in which we hold a \u201ccontrolling financial interest.\u201d For voting interest entities, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest when we are able to exercise control over the investees\u2019 operating and financial decisions. For variable interest entities (VIEs), the determination of which is based on the amount and characteristics of the entity\u2019s equity, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the party that has both: (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact that VIE\u2019s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb the losses of, or the right to receive the benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to that VIE. Entities in which our voting interest in common equity does not provide it with control, but allows us to exert significant influence over operating and financial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method. We also have investments in equity securities where our voting interest is below the level of significant influence, including investments that we make in non-public companies in the ordinary course of business. Such investments are initially recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value through earnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar transactions of the same company or if they are determined to be impaired. See Note 4 for the accounting policy for our marketable equity securities. FOREIGN CURRENCY Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period; non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historic exchange rate at the date of the transaction; revenues and expenses are translated at the average month-end exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments, along with any related qualifying hedge and tax effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), a component of shareholders\u2019 equity. Translation adjustments, including qualifying hedge and tax effects, are reclassified to earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of investments in foreign operations. Gains and losses related to transactions in a currency other than the functional currency are reported in Other, net expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Accounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management\u2019s assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. INCOME STATEMENT Discount Revenue Discount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant\u2019s overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. The card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three In cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue. Revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material. Net Card Fees Net card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (refer to Note 9). Other Fees and Commissions Other fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged. Refer to Note 18 for additional information. Contra-revenue Payments made pursuant to contractual arrangements with our merchants, GNS partners, and other customers are classified as contra-revenue, except where we receive goods, services or other benefits for which the fair value is determinable and measurable, in which case they are recorded as expense. Interest Income Interest on Card Member loans is assessed using the average daily balance method. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding, in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement, until the outstanding balance is paid, or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relate to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on the investment security\u2019s outstanding balance. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess of near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Interest Expense Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as the realized impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk on our long-term debt. Marketing and Business Development Marketing and business development expense includes costs incurred in the development and initial placement of advertising, which are expensed in the year in which the advertising first takes place. Also included in Marketing and business development expense are payments to our cobrand partners, Card Member statement credits for qualifying charges on eligible card accounts, corporate incentive payments earned on achievement of pre-set targets, and certain payments to GNS card issuing partners. These costs are generally expensed as incurred. Card Member Rewards We issue charge and credit cards that allow Card Members to participate in various rewards programs (e.g., Membership Rewards, cobrand and cash back). Rewards expense is recognized in the period Card Members earn rewards, generally by spending on their enrolled card products. We record a Card Member rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed. Pursuant to cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner\u2019s own loyalty program. Card Member rewards liabilities are impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. Changes in the Card Member rewards liabilities during the period are taken as an increase or decrease to the Card Member rewards expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. BALANCE SHEET Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank balances, including securities purchased under resale agreements, restricted cash, and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Restricted cash primarily represents amounts related to Card Member credit balances as well as upcoming debt maturities of consolidated VIEs. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We allocate goodwill to our reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business that is one level below an operating segment, for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by the operating segment manager. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting units below its carrying value. Prior to completing the assessment of goodwill for impairment, we also perform a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Alternatively, we can perform a more detailed quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. This qualitative assessment entails the evaluation of factors such as economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using the quantitative assessment. Under the quantitative assessment, the first step identifies whether there is a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then a test is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized based on the amount that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value. When measuring the fair value of our reporting units in the quantitative assessment, we use widely accepted valuation techniques, applying a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples). When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we use internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. To discount these cash flows, we use the expected cost of equity, determined by using a capital asset pricing model. We believe the discount rates used appropriately reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally-developed forecasts. When using market multiples under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies\u2019 multiples (e.g., earnings or revenues) to our reporting units\u2019 actual results. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred during construction are capitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years for equipment, furniture and building improvements, and from 40 to 50 years for premises, which are depreciated based upon their estimated useful life at the acquisition date. Certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software are also capitalized and recorded in Premises and equipment. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software\u2019s estimated useful life, generally 5 years. We review these assets for impairment using the same impairment methodology used for our intangible assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility, or the economic life of the improvement, and range from 5 to 10 years. We recognize lease restoration obligations at the fair value of the restoration liabilities when incurred and amortize the restoration assets over the lease term. Leases We have operating leases worldwide for facilities and equipment, which, for those leases with terms greater than 12 months, are recorded as lease-related assets and liabilities. We do not separate lease and non-lease components. Lease-related assets, or right-of-use assets, are recognized at the lease commencement date at amounts equal to the respective lease liabilities, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, initial direct costs and lease incentives. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the contractual fixed lease payments, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date or upon modification of the lease. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.

RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting guidance related to the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The guidance, effective for reporting periods through December 31, 2022, provides accounting relief for contract modifications that replace an interest rate impacted by reference rate reform (e.g., LIBOR) with a new alternative reference rate. The guidance is applicable to investment securities, receivables, loans, debt, leases, derivatives and hedge accounting elections and other contractual arrangements. We adopted the guidance as of March 31, 2020, with no material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There were no significant changes to our accounting policies, business processes or internal controls as a result of adopting the new guidance. Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted the new credit reserving methodology, applicable to certain financial instruments, known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology under a modified retrospective transition. The CECL methodology requires measurement of expected credit losses for the estimated life of the financial instrument, not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. Upon implementation, total loan reserves increased by $1,663 million and total receivable reserves decreased by $493 million, along with the associated current and deferred tax impact of $288 million, and an offset to the opening balance of retained earnings, net of tax, of $882 million. There were no material changes to our business processes or internal controls as a result of adopting the new guidance. Refer to Note 3 for additional information on how management estimates reserves for credit losses in accordance with the CECL methodology. In addition, for available-for-sale debt securities, the new methodology replaces the other-than-temporary impairment model and requires the recognition of an allowance for reductions in a security\u2019s fair value attributable to declines in credit quality, instead of a direct write-down of the security, when a valuation decline is determined to be other-than-temporary. There was no financial impact related to this implementation.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nChange in Accounting Principle \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nReserves for Credit Losses on Card Member Loans \n\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans represent management\u2019s estimate of the expected credit losses in the Company\u2019s outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans as of the balance sheet date. The reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans was $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2020. Management estimates lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period) beyond the balance sheet date. In estimating expected credit losses, management uses a combination of statistically-based models that entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of the Company\u2019s reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. Management uses these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan balances to produce its reserves for expected credit losses. Within the R&S Period, the Company\u2019s models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. Beyond the R&S Period, expected credit losses are estimated by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. Management also estimates the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off loans considering how long ago the loan was written off and future economic conditions. Additionally, management evaluates whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the models, significant inputs, qualitative reserves, and significant assumptions, including the R&S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for estimating the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans through (i) evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and significant assumptions used to estimate the reserves. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s methodology and the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and certain significant assumptions, including the R&S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period. \n\nMembership Rewards Liability \n\nAs described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Membership Rewards liability represents management\u2019s estimate of the cost of Membership Rewards points earned that are expected to be redeemed in the future. The Membership Rewards liability was $9.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. The URR assumption is used by management to estimate the number of points earned that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from the previous 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Membership Rewards liability is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the URR involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the models, significant inputs and assumptions used by management, (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge and (iii) the estimate of the WAC involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating the methodology. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the estimate of the Membership Rewards liability, including the URR and WAC assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs to the statistical and actuarial models used to estimate the URR assumption, including redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, and card spend levels, (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of the URR assumption and comparing the independent estimate to management\u2019s assumption to evaluate its reasonableness, (iii) evaluating management\u2019s methodology for determining the WAC assumption and (iv) comparing our independently calculated Membership Rewards liability to management\u2019s estimate. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nNew York, New York \n\nFebruary 12, 2021 \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2005. \n\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n \n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nPAGE \n\nConsolidated Statements of Income \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 20 20 , 201 9 and 201 8 \n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 20 20 , 201 9 and 201 8 \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \u2013 December 31, 20 20 and 201 9 \n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 20 20 , 201 9 and 201 8 \n\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders\u2019 Equity \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 20 20 , 201 9 and 201 8 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nNote 2 \u2013 Loans and Card Member Receivables \n\nNote 3 \u2013 Reserves for Credit Losses \n\nNote 4 \u2013 Investment Securities \n\nNote 5 \u2013 Asset Securitizations \n\nNote 6 \u2013 Other Assets \n\nNote 7 \u2013 Customer Deposits \n\nNote 8 \u2013 Debt \n\nNote 9 \u2013 Other Liabilities \n\nNote 1 0 \u2013 Stock Plans \n\nNote 1 1 \u2013 Retirement Plans \n\nNote 1 2 \u2013 Contingencies and Commitments \n\nNote 1 3 \u2013 Derivatives and Hedging Activities \n\nNote 1 4 \u2013 Fair Values \n\nNote 1 5 \u2013 Guarantees \n\nNote 1 6 \u2013 Common and Preferred Shares \n\nNote 1 7 \u2013 Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income \n\nNote 18 \u2013 Other Fees and Commissions and Other Expenses \n\nNote 19 \u2013 Restructuring \n\nNote 2 0 \u2013 Income Taxes \n\nNote 2 1 \u2013 Earnings Per Common Share (EPS) \n\nNote 2 2 \u2013 Regulatory Matters and Capital Adequacy \n\nNote 2 3 \u2013 Significant Credit Concentrations \n\nNote 2 4 \u2013 Reportable Operating Segments and Geographic Operations \n\nNote 2 5 \u2013 Parent Company \n\nNote 2 6 \u2013 Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) \n\n\n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME \n\n \n\nYear Ended December 31 (Millions, except per share amounts) \n\n2020 2019 2018 Revenues Non-interest revenues Discount revenue $ 20,401 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496221000013/axp-20201231.htm"}, "2019": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES THE C OMPANY We are a globally integrated payments company that provides our customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our principal products and services are credit and charge card products, along with travel and lifestyle related services, offered to consumers and businesses around the world. Business travel-related services are offered through the non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Business Travel. Our various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party vendors and business partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams, and direct response advertising. Effective for the first quarter of 2019, we moved intercompany assets and liabilities, previously recorded in the operating segments, to Corporate & Other. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. Refer to Note 24 for additional discussion of the products and services that comprise each segment. Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. We consolidate entities in which we hold a \u201ccontrolling financial interest.\u201d For voting interest entities, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest when we are able to exercise control over the investees\u2019 operating and financial decisions. For variable interest entities (VIEs), the determination of which is based on the amount and characteristics of the entity\u2019s equity, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the party that has both: (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact that VIE\u2019s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb the losses of, or the right to receive the benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to that VIE. Entities in which our voting interest in common equity does not provide it with control, but allows us to exert significant influence over operating and financial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method. We also have investments in equity securities where our voting interest is below the level of significant influence, including investments that we make in non-public companies in the ordinary course of business. Such investments are initially recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value through earnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar transactions of the same company or if they are determined to be impaired. See Note 4 for the accounting policy for our marketable equity securities. FOREIGN CURRENCY Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period; non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historic exchange rate at the date of the transaction; revenues and expenses are translated at the average month-end exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments, along with any related qualifying hedge and tax effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), a component of shareholders\u2019 equity. Translation adjustments, including qualifying hedge and tax effects, are reclassified to earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of investments in foreign operations. Gains and losses related to transactions in a currency other than the functional currency are reported in Other, net expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Accounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management\u2019s assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. INCOME STATEMENT Discount Revenue Discount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant\u2019s overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. The card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three In cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue. Revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material. Net Card Fees Net card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (refer to Note 9). Other Fees and Commissions Other fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged. Refer to Note 18 for additional information. Contra-revenue Payments made pursuant to contractual arrangements with our merchants, GNS partners, and other customers are classified as contra-revenue, except where we receive goods, services or other benefits for which the fair value is determinable and measurable, in which case they are recorded as expense. Interest Income Interest on Card Member loans is assessed using the average daily balance method. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding, in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement, until the outstanding balance is paid, or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relate to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on the investment security\u2019s outstanding balance. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess of near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Interest Expense Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as the realized impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk on our long-term debt. Marketing and Business Development Marketing and business development expense includes costs incurred in the development and initial placement of advertising, which are expensed in the year in which the advertising first takes place. Also included in Marketing and business development expense are payments to our cobrand partners, Card Member statement credits for qualifying charges on eligible card accounts, corporate incentive payments earned on achievement of pre-set targets, and certain payments to GNS card issuing partners. These costs are generally expensed as incurred. Card Member Rewards We issue charge and credit cards that allow Card Members to participate in various rewards programs (e.g., Membership Rewards, cobrand and cash back). Rewards expense is recognized in the period Card Members earn rewards, generally by spending on their enrolled card products. We record a Card Member rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed. Pursuant to cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner\u2019s own loyalty program. Card Member rewards liabilities are impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. Changes in the Card Member rewards liabilities during the period are taken as an increase or decrease to the Card Member rewards expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. BALANCE SHEET Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank balances, including securities purchased under resale agreements, and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We allocate goodwill to our reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business that is one level below an operating segment, for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by the operating segment manager. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting units below its carrying value. Prior to completing the assessment of goodwill for impairment, we also perform a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Alternatively, we can perform a more detailed quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. This qualitative assessment entails the evaluation of factors such as economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using the quantitative assessment. Under the quantitative assessment, the first step identifies whether there is a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then a test is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized based on the amount that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value. When measuring the fair value of our reporting units in the quantitative assessment, we use widely accepted valuation techniques, applying a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples). When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we use internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. To discount these cash flows, we use the expected cost of equity, determined by using a capital asset pricing model. We believe the discount rates used appropriately reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally-developed forecasts. When using market multiples under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies\u2019 multiples (e.g., earnings or revenues) to our reporting units\u2019 actual results. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we performed a qualitative assessment in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred during construction are capitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years for equipment, furniture and building improvements, and from 40 to 50 years for premises, which are depreciated based upon their estimated useful life at the acquisition date. Certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software are also capitalized and recorded in Premises and equipment. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software\u2019s estimated useful life, generally 5 years. We review these assets for impairment using the same impairment methodology used for our intangible assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility, or the economic life of the improvement, and range from 5 to 10 years. We recognize lease restoration obligations at the fair value of the restoration liabilities when incurred and amortize the restoration assets over the lease term. Leases On January 1, 2019, we adopted the new accounting guidance on leases using the modified retrospective method. We elected the package of practical expedients and transition provisions allowing us to bring our existing operating leases onto the Consolidated Balance Sheet on January 1, 2019 without adjusting comparative periods. The adoption of the new lease guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We have operating leases worldwide for facilities and equipment, which, for those leases with terms greater than 12 months, are recorded as lease-related assets and liabilities. We do not separate lease and non-lease components. Lease-related assets, or right-of-use assets, are recognized at the lease commencement date at amounts equal to the respective lease liabilities, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, initial direct costs and lease incentives. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the contractual fixed lease payments, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date or upon modification of the lease. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on certain financial instruments. The guidance, as amended and effective January 1, 2020, introduces a new credit reserving methodology known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) approach, which differs significantly from the incurred loss approach used through December 31, 2019 and alters the estimation process, inputs and assumptions used in estimating credit losses. The CECL methodology requires measurement of expected credit losses for the estimated life of the financial instrument, not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. Our approach incorporates separate reasonable and supportable periods for loans and receivables and uses a weighted average of multiple future economic scenarios. Additionally, the guidance requires a modified retrospective transition, which records the difference between the reserves measured using the CECL methodology and the reserves using the incurred loss approach, tax effected, as a cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption through retained earnings. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and regulatory risk-based capital for periods prior to January 1, 2020 will not be restated. We currently estimate an increase to total loan reserves of approximately $1.7 billion and a decrease to total receivable reserves of approximately $0.5 billion, along with the associated current and deferred tax impact of approximately $0.3 billion, and an offset to the opening balance of retained earnings, net of tax, of approximately $0.9 billion as of January 1, 2020. Our cross-functional implementation team is finalizing our operational processes, controls and governance. In addition, for available-for-sale debt securities, the new guidance replaces the other-than-temporary impairment model and requires the recognition of an allowance for reductions in a security\u2019s fair value attributable to declines in credit quality, instead of a direct write-down of the security, when a valuation decline is determined to be other-than-temporary. We have completed our evaluation of the new guidance for our available-for-sale debt securities and, while there was no impact of the new guidance on adoption, we have updated our processes to evaluate and measure potential future credit losses."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": NaN, "Debt": {"Debt": ["DEBT SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS Our short-term borrowings outstanding, defined as borrowings with original contractual maturity dates of less than one year, as of December 31 were as follows: 2019 2018 (Millions, except percentages) Outstanding Balance Year-End Stated Interest Rate on Debt (a) Outstanding Balance Year-End Stated Interest Rate on Debt (a) Commercial paper (b) $ 3,001 1.94 % $ 752 2.71 % Other short-term borrowings (c) 3,441 1.28 2,348 1.94 Total $ 6,442 1.59 % $ 3,100 2.13 % (a) For floating-rate issuances, the stated interest rates are weighted based on the outstanding principal balances and interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

The availability of the credit line is subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants, principally the maintenance by American Express Credit Corporation (Credco) of a 1.25 ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges, to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we were not in violation of any of our debt covenants. Additionally, we maintained a three-year committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility that gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible notes issued from the Charge Trust at any time through July 15, 2022. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, nil and $1.5 billion, respectively, were drawn on this facility. We paid $16.5 million and $14.2 million in fees to maintain these lines in 2019 and 2018, respectively. These committed facilities do not contain material adverse change clauses, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facilities, nor are they dependent on our credit rating. We paid total interest, primarily related to short- and long-term debt, corresponding interest rate swaps and customer deposits, of $3.4 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.0 billion in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively."]}, "external_audit": "independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report appearing on the following page on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Express Company and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders\u2019 equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated \n\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nMembership Rewards Liability - Ultimate Redemption Rate \n\nAs described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Membership Rewards liability represents management\u2019s estimate of the cost of Membership Rewards points earned that are expected to be redeemed in the future. The Membership Rewards liability was $8.9 billion as of December 31, 2019. The weighted average cost per point and the ultimate redemption rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. The URR assumption is used by management to estimate the number of points earned that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the URR for the Membership Rewards liability is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the URR involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating results relating to the models, significant inputs and assumptions used by management; and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the estimate of the Membership Rewards liability, including the URR assumption. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of certain inputs to the statistical and actuarial models used to estimate the URR assumption, including redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, and card spend levels, (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of the URR assumption and comparing the independent estimate to management\u2019s assumption to evaluate its reasonableness, and (iii) comparing the independent estimate of the Membership Rewards liability to management\u2019s estimate. \n\nReserves for Losses on Card Member Loans - Qualitative Reserve Component \n\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, reserves for losses on Card Member loans represent management\u2019s estimate of the probable inherent losses in the Company\u2019s outstanding portfolio of loans, as of the balance sheet date. Reserves for losses are primarily based upon statistical and analytical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect management\u2019s judgments regarding the quantitative components of the reserve. These models take into account several factors, including delinquency-based loss migration rates, loss emergence periods and average losses and recoveries over an appropriate historical period. Management considers whether to adjust the quantitative reserves for certain external and internal qualitative factors, which may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on Card Member loans (the \u201cqualitative reserve component\u201d). These external factors include employment, spend, sentiment, housing and credit, and changes in the legal and regulatory environment, while the internal factors include increased risk in certain portfolios, impact of risk management initiatives, changes in underwriting requirements and overall process stability. The qualitative reserve component represents a portion of the total reserves for losses on Card Member loans of $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the qualitative reserve component of the reserves for losses on Card Member loans is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment required by management in estimating the qualitative reserve component, including determination of underlying factors, which led to a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures relating to the methodology and the underlying factors; and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the reserves for losses on Card Member loans, including the qualitative reserve component. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for determining the qualitative reserve component of the reserves for losses on Card Member loans through (i) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to evaluate the appropriateness of management\u2019s methodology for estimating the qualitative reserve component, including evaluating whether certain factors are reasonable given the current macroeconomic conditions and portfolio characteristics and (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of specific data inputs and evaluating the reasonableness of specific assumptions related to certain external factors applied by management in estimating the qualitative reserve component. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nNew York, New York \n\nFebruary 13, 2020 \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2005. \n\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n \n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nPAGE \n\nConsolidated Statements of Income \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 201 9 , 201 8 and 201 7 \n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 201 9 , 201 8 and 201 7 \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \u2013 December 31, 201 9 and 201 8 \n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 201 9 , 201 8 and 201 7 \n\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders\u2019 Equity \u2013 For the Years Ended December 31, 201 9 , 201 8 and 201 7 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nNote 2 \u2013 Loans and Accounts Receivable \n\nNote 3 \u2013 Reserves for Losses \n\nNote 4 \u2013 Investment Securities \n\nNote 5 \u2013 Asset Securitizations \n\nNote 6 \u2013 Other Assets \n\nNote 7 \u2013 Customer Deposits \n\nNote 8 \u2013 Debt \n\nNote 9 \u2013 Other Liabilities \n\nNote 1 0 \u2013 Stock Plans \n\nNote 1 1 \u2013 Retirement Plans \n\nNote 1 2 \u2013 Contingencies and Commitments \n\nNote 1 3 \u2013 Derivatives and Hedging Activities \n\nNote 1 4 \u2013 Fair Values \n\nNote 1 5 \u2013 Guarantees \n\nNote 1 6 \u2013 Common and Preferred Shares \n\nNote 1 7 \u2013 Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income \n\nNote 18 \u2013 Other Fees and Commissions and Other Expenses \n\nNote 19 \u2013 Restructuring \n\nNote 2 0 \u2013 Income Taxes \n\nNote 2 1 \u2013 Earnings Per Common Share \n\nNote 2 2 \u2013 Regulatory Matters and Capital Adequacy \n\nNote 2 3 \u2013 Significant Credit Concentrations \n\nNote 2 4 \u2013 Reportable Operating Segments and Geographic Operations \n\nNote 2 5 \u2013 Parent Company \n\nNote 2 6 \u2013 Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) \n\n\n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME \n\n \n\nYear Ended December 31 (Millions, except per share amounts) \n\n2019 2018 2017 Revenues Non-interest revenues Discount revenue $ 26,167 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000000496220000030/axp-20191231.htm"}, "2018": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Basis of Presentation": ["NOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The Company Americ an Express Company is a globally integrated payments company that provides customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our principal products and service s are charge and credit card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and bu sinesses around the world. Business travel-related services are offered through the non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Bu siness Travel (the GBT JV). Our various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, includ ing consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including mobile and online applications, direct mail, in-house sales teams, third-party vendors and direct response advertising. Effective for the second quarter of 2018, we realigned our reportable operating segments to reflect the organizational changes announced during the first quarter of 2018. Prior periods have been revised to conform to the new reportable opera ting segments, which are as follows: Global Consumer Services Group (GCSG), which primarily issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards globally. GCSG also provides services to consumers, including travel services and non-card financing products, and manages certain international joint ventures and our partnership agreements in China. Global Commercial Services (GCS), which primarily issues a wide range of proprietary corporate and small business cards and provides payment and expense management serv ices globally. In addition, GCS provides commercial financing products. Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS), which operates a global payments network that processes and settles card transactions, acquires merchants and provides multi-channel market ing programs and capabilities, services and data analytics, leveraging our g lobal integrated network. GMNS manages our partnership relationships wi th third-party card issuers, merchant acquirers and a prepaid reloadable and gift card program manager , licen sing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network. GMNS also manages loyalty coalition businesses in cer tain countries around the world . Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. We consolidat e entities in which we hold a \u201ccontrolling financial interest.\u201d For voting interest entities, we are considered to hold a controlli ng financial interest when we are able to exercise control over the investees\u2019 operating and financial decisions. For variable interest entities (VIEs) , the determination of which is based on the amount and characteristics of the entity\u2019s equity, we are considered to hold a controllin g financial interest when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. A primary bene ficiary is the party that has both: (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact that VIE\u2019s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb the losses of, or the right to receive the benefits from, the VIE that could p otenti ally be significant to that VIE. Entities in which our voting interest in common equity does not provide it with control, but allows us to exert significant influence over operating and financial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method. We als o have investments in equity securities where our voting interest is below the level of significant influence, including investments that we make in non-public companies in the ordinary course of business . Such investments are initially recorded at cost a nd adjusted to fair value through earnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar transactions of the same company or if they are determined to be impaired . See Note 5 for the accounting policy for our marketable equi ty securities. Foreign Currency Monetary a ssets and liabili ties denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon exchange rates prevailing at the e nd of the reporting period; non- monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historic exchange rate at the date of the transaction; revenues and expenses are translated at the average month-end exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments, along with any related qualifying hedge and tax effects, are inc luded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), a component of shareholders\u2019 equity. Translation adjustments, including qualifying hedge and tax effects, are reclassified to earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of investments in foreign operations. Gains and losses related to transactions in a currency other than the functional currency are reported net in Other expenses, in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts Based on Estimates and Assumptions Accounting estimat es are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management\u2019s assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member losses on l oans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability , goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. Income statement Discount Revenue Discount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Membe rs. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merc hant\u2019s overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. The card acceptance agreement s, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed per iods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network. In cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which i s the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue. Net Card Fees Net card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary ba sed on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred a nd recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (refer t o Note 10). Other Fees and Commissions Other fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Conso lidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged. Refer to Note 19 for additional information. Contra-revenue P ayments made pursuant to contractual arrangements with our merchants, GNS partners, and other customers are classified as contra-revenue , except where we receive goods, serv ices or other benefits for which the fair value is determinable and measurable, in which case they are recorded as expense. Interest Income Interest on Card Member loans is assessed using the average daily balance method. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding, in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement, until the outstanding balance is paid, or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities prima rily relate to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is r ecognized on the investment security\u2019s outstanding balance. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest on deposits with banks and other is rec ognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess of near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Interest Expense Interest exp ense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily r elates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as the realized impact of derivatives used to hedge interest r ate risk on our long-term debt. Marketing and Business Development As further described below under \u201cRecently Adopted Accounting Standards,\u201d effective January 1, 2018, in conjunction with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, the previousl y disclosed \u201cMarketing and p romotion\u201d line on the Consolidated Statements of Income was changed to \u201cMarketing and b usiness d evelopment\u201d to reflect the inclusion of certain reclassified costs from c ontra-discount revenue and Other expenses. Marketing and bu siness development provides a more comprehensive view of costs related to building and growing our business, including the reclassified costs. Marketing and business development expense includes costs incurred in the development and initial placement of a dvertising, which are expensed in the year in which the advertising first takes place. Also included in Marketing and business development expense are Card Member statement credits for qualifying charges on eligible card accounts, corporate incentive payme nts earned on achievement of preset targets, and certain payments to GNS card issuing partners. These costs are generally expensed as incurred. Card Member Rewards We issue charge and credit cards that allow Card Members to participate in various rewards programs (e.g., Membership Rewards, cobrand and cash back). Rewards expense is recognized in the period Card Members earn rewards, generally by spending on their enrolled card products. We record a Card Member rewards liability that represents the estima ted cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed. Pursuant to cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner\u2019s own loyalty program. Card Member rewards liabilities are impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. Changes in the Card Member rewards liabilities during the period are taken as an increase or decrease to the Card Member rewards expense in the Consolidated Statemen t of Income . Effective January 1, 2018, in conjunction with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, Card Member rewards also includes cash-back rewards, which were reclassified from contra discount revenue. Balance Sheet Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank balances, including securities purchased under resale agreements, and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We allocate goodwill to our reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business that is one level below an operating segment, for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by the operating segment manager. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting units below its carrying value. Prior to completing the assess ment of goodwill for impairment, we also perform a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a repo rting unit is less than its carrying value. Alternatively, we can perform a more detailed quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. This qualitative assessment entails the evaluation of factors such as economic conditions, industry and market consid erations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit - specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we t hen perform the impairment evaluation using the quantitative a ssessment . Under the quantitative assessment , t he first step identifies whether there is a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount, includin g goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then a test is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized based on the amount that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the i mplied fair value. When measuring the fair value of our reporting units in the quantitative assessment , we use widely accepted valuation techniques, applying a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multip les). When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we use internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. To discount these cash flows, we use the expected cost of equity, determine d by using a capital asset pricing model. We believe the discount rates used appropriately reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally - developed forecasts. When using market multiples under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies\u2019 multiples (e.g., earnings or revenues) to our reporting units\u2019 actual results. For the year s ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we performed a qualitative assessment in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment, including leasehold impro vements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred during construction are capitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated usef ul lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years for equipment, furniture and building improvements, and from 40 to 50 years for premises, which are depreciated based upon their estimated useful life at th e acquisition date. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility, or the economic life of the improvement, and ranges from 5 to 10 years. We maintai n operating leases worldwide for facilities and equipment. Rent expense for facility leases is recognized ratably over the lease term, and includes adjustments for rent concessions, rent escalations and leasehold improvement allowances. We recognize lease restoration obligations at the fair value of the restoration liabilities when incurred and amortize the restoration assets over the lease term. Certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software are also capitalized and recorded in Premises and equipment. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software\u2019s estimated useful life, generally 5 years. We review these assets for impairment using the same impairment methodology used for our intangible assets.

Recently Issued and adopted Accounting Standards Recently Issued Accounting Standards In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance on leases. The accounting standard, effective January 1, 2019, requires virtually all leases to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2019, our financial s tatements will reflect the adoption of this standard using the modified retrospective method. We have elected the package of practical expedients and transition provisions allowing us to bring our existing operating leases onto the Consolidated Balance She e t without adjusting comparative periods. We have operating leases worldwide for facilities and equipment, which will be recorded as lease-related assets and liabilities upon adoption of the new guidance for those leases with terms greater than 12 months. Under the guidance, we have also elected to not separate lease and non-lease components in the recognition of the assets and liabilities, as well as the related lease expense. Lease-related assets, or right-of-use assets, will be recognized at the lease c ommencement date at amounts equal to the respective lease liabilities, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, and initial direct costs, and offset by lease incentives received. Lease-related liabilities will be recognized at the present value of the remainin g contractual fixed lease payments, discounted using the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease expense will continue to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments will continue to be expensed a s incurred. The adoption of the standard will have the impact of increasing consolidated assets and l iabilities by approximately $700 million and will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or regulatory ris k-based capital. In conjunction with the adoption, we are upgrading our lease administration software and modifying our business processes and internal controls. In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. We do not intend to early adopt the new standard. The guidance introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) mode l, which is based on expected losses, and differs significantly from the incurred loss approach used today. The CECL model requires measurement of expected credit losses not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. In addition, for available-for-sale debt securities, the new guidance replaces the other-than-temporary impairment model, and requires the recognition of an allowance for reduc tions in a security\u2019s fair value attributable to declines in credit quality, instead of a direct write-down of the security, when a valuation decline is determined to be other-than-temporary. The guidance also requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to ret ained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption. We continue to evaluate the impact the new guidance will have on our financial position, re sults of operations, cash flows, credit ratings and regulatory risk-based capital. We expect that the CECL model will alter the assumptions used in estimating credit losses on Card Member loans and receivables, and may result in material increases to our credit reserves as the new guidance involves earlier recognition of expected losses for the li fe of the assets. However, the extent of the impact will depend on the characteristics of our loan portfolio, macroeconomic conditions and forecasted information at the date of adoption. We continue to be actively engaged in cross-functional implementatio n efforts and are in the process of developing and implementing CECL models that satisfy the requirements of the new standard, along with appropriate business processes and controls. In February 2018, as a result of the enactmen t of the Tax Cuts and Jobs A ct (the Tax Act) , the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the reclassification of certain tax effects from AOCI to retained earnings. The optional reclassification is effective January 1, 2019. We are evaluating the new guidance , along with any impacts on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, none of whi ch are expected to be material. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted new revenue recognition guidance issued by the FASB related to contracts with customers. The scope of the new guidance excludes financial instruments such as credit and charge card arrangements. We elected to adopt the standard using the full retrospective method, which we believe is most useful to our investors. Under the full retrospective method, we are applying the standard back to January 1, 2016. As shown below, the most significant impacts of adoption are changes to the classification of certain revenues and expenses, including certain credit and charge card related costs previously netted against discount revenue, such as Card Member cash-back reward costs and statement credits, corporate incentive payments, as w ell as payments to third-party GNS card issuing partners. Under the new revenue standard, these costs are not considered components of the transaction price of our card acceptance agreements with merchants and thus are not netted against discount revenue, but instead are recognized as expenses. Our payments to third-party GNS card issuing partners are presented net of related revenues earned from the partners. The impact to the 2017 fiscal quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follo ws: Increase (Decrease) Three months ended Year Ended December (Millions) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017 2017 2016 Revenues Discount revenue $ 981 $ 930 $ 928 $ 868 $ 3,707 $ 3,699 Other (78) (71) (64) (65) (278) (253) Expenses Marketing and business development 617 591 593 549 2,350 2,420 Card Member rewards $ 286 $ 268 $ 271 $ 254 $ 1,079 $ 1,026 In addition, the cumulative impact to our retained earnings on January 1, 2016 was an increase of $55.2 million. The adoption of the new guidance also resulted in changes to the recognition timing of certain revenues, the impact of which is not material to net income. Similarly, the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or cash flows . We had no material c ontract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. In adopting the guidance, we implemented changes to our accounting policies, business processes, systems and internal controls to support the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements under the new standard. Such changes were not material. In January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, which was effective and adopted by us as of January 1, 2018. The guidance makes targeted changes to GAAP; specifically to the classification and measurement of equity securities, and to certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial assets and liabilities. This applies to investments we make in non-public companies in the ordinary course of business, which historically were recognized under the cost method of accounting. These investments will be prosp ectively adjusted through earnings for observable price changes upon the identification of identical or similar transactions of the same company. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations a nd cash flows. We implemented changes to our accounting policies, business processes and internal controls in support of the new guidance. Such changes were not material. In August 2017, the FASB issued new accounting guidance providing targeted improvem ents to the accounting for hedging activities, effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted in any interim period or fiscal year before the effective date. The guidance introduces a number of amendments, several of which are optional, that are designed to simplify the application of hedge accounting, improve financial statement transparency and more closely align hedge accounting with an entity\u2019s risk management strategies. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the guidance, with no material imp act on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, along with associated changes to our accounting policies, business processes and internal controls in support of the new guidance. Such changes were not material. "]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["NOTE 13 Contingencies and commitments Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various pending and potential legal actions, arbitration proceedings, claims, investigations, examinations, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations (collectively, legal proceedings). We disclose our material legal proceedings under Part I, Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings . \u201d In addition to the m atters disclosed under \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d we are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain of our international transactions, which are in various stages of audit, or are being con tested in legal actions (collectively, VAT matters). While we believe we have complied with all applicable tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional VAT. In certain jurisdictions where we are contesting the assessments, we were required to pay the VAT assessments prior to contesting. Our legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members. These legal proceedin gs involve various lines of business and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, common law tort, contract, application of tax laws, antitrust and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. While some matters pending against us specify the damages claimed by the plaintiff or class, many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process. Even when the amount of damages claimed against us are state d, the claimed amount may be exaggerated and/or unsupported. As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss, while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss. We have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceedings. A n accrual is recorded when it i s both (a) probable that a loss has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrual . We evaluate , on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings that could ca use an increase or decrease in the amount of the accrual that has been previously recorded, or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses, as applicable. For those disclosed material legal proceedings and VAT matters where a loss is re asonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a recorded accrual for legal or tax contingencies or where there is no such accrual , and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $ 400 million in excess of any accrual s related to those matters. This range represents management\u2019s estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our maximum loss exposure; actual results may vary significantly. As such legal proceedi ngs evolve, we may need to increase our range of possible loss or recorded accruals . In addition, it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the Card Member experience as a result of an adverse resolution in one or any combination of the me rchant cases disclosed in Part I , Item 3 . \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d could have a material adverse effect on our business. Based on our current knowledge, and taking into consideration our litigation-related liabilities, we believe we are not a party to, nor are any of our properties the subject of, any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, it is possible that the outcome of legal proce edings, including the possible resolution of merchant claims, could have a material impact on our results of operations . COMMITMENTS We lease certain facilities and equipment under non-cancelable and cancelable agreements, for which total rental expense was $ 142 million, $ 151 million and $ 169 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , the minimum aggregate rental commitment under all non-cancelable operating leases (net of subleases of $ 14 million) was as follows: (Millions) 2019 $ 140 2020 118 2021 95 2022 78 2023 65 Thereafter 832 Total $ 1,328 As of December 31, 2018 , our future minimum lease payments under capital leases or other similar arrangements is approximately $ 4 million in each of 201 9 and 202 0 , $ 1 million in each of 202 1 and 2022, $ 2 million in 2023 and $ 8 million in aggregate thereafter. As of December 31, 2018 , we had $ 5.0 billion in commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners under which we make payments based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewar ds earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained .

The Company\u2019s principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered t o consumers and businesses around the world. Business travel-related services are offered through the non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Bu siness Travel (the GBT JV). The Company\u2019s various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including direct mail, online applications, in-house and third-party sales forces and direct response advertising. Effective for the first quarter of 2016, the Company realigned its segment presentation to reflect the organizational changes announced during the fourth quarter of 2015. Prior periods have been restated to conform to the new reportable operating segments. Refer to Note 25 for additional discussion of the products and services that comprise each segment. Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other. Principles of Consolidati on The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. The Company consolidates entitie s in which it holds a \u201ccontrolling financial interest.\u201d For voting interest entities, the Company is considered to hold a controlling financial interest when it is able to exercise control over the investees\u2019 operating and financial decisions. For variable interest entities (VIEs), the determination of which is based on the amount and characteristics of the entity\u2019s equity, the Company is considered to hold a controlling financial interest when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary. A primary benef iciary is the party that has both: (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact that VIE\u2019s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb the losses of, or the right to receive the benefits from, the VIE that could p otentia lly be significant to that VIE. Entities in which the Company\u2019s voting interest in common equity does not provide it with control, but allows the Company to exert significant influence over operating and financial decisions, are accounted for under the equ ity method. All other investments in equity securities, to the extent they are not considered marketable securities, are accounted for under the cost method. Foreign Currency Monetary a ssets and liabili ties denominated in foreign currencies are translate d into U.S. dollars based upon exchange rates prevailing at the e nd of the reporting period; non- monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historic exchange rate at the date of the transaction; revenues and expenses are translated at the averag e month-end exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments, along with any related qualifying hedge and tax effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), a component of shareholders\u2019 equity. Translation a djustments, including qualifying hedge and tax effects, are reclassified to earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of investments in foreign operations. Gains and losses related to transactions in a currency other than the functional currency ar e reported net in Other expenses, in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income. Net for eign currency transaction gains amounted to approximately $7 million and $68 million in 2017 and 2015, respectively, and net foreign currency transaction losses amounted to $18 million in 2016 . Amounts Based on Estimates and Assumptions Accounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management\u2019s assumptions concerning future events . Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member losses on loans and receivables, the proprietary point liability for Membership Rewards costs, fair value measurements, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting e stimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. Income statement Discount Revenue Discount revenue generally represents the amount earned by the Company on transactions occurring at merchants with which the Company, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner, has entered into a card acceptance agreement for facilitating transactions between the merchants and the Company\u2019s Card Members. The amount of fees charged, or merchant discount, is generally deducted from the payme nt to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time a Card Member enters into a point-of-sale transaction with a merchant. Where the Company acts as the merchant acquirer and the card presented at a merchant is issued by a third-party financial institution, such as in the case of GNS partners, the Company makes financial settlement to the merchant and receives the discount revenue. In the Company\u2019s role as the operator of the card network, it also receives financial settlement from the GNS card issuer, which in turn receives an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and the Company. The difference between the merchant discount the Company receives from the merchant (which is directly agreed between a merchant and the Comp any , and is not based on the issuer rate) and the issuer rate received by the GNS card issuer is recorded as discount revenue. In cases where the Company is the card issuer and the merchant acquirer is a third party (which can be the case in a country in which an Independent Operator partner is the local merchant acquirer or in the United States under our OptBlue program with certain third-party merchant acquirers), the Company receives a network rate in its settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between the Company and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue. In contrast with networks such as those operated by Visa Inc. and MasterCard Incorporated, there are no collectively set interchange rates on the Am erican Express network, issuer rates do not serve as a basis for merchant discount rates and no fees are agreed or due between the third-party financial institution participants on the network. Net Card Fees Net card fees represent revenue earned from annual ca rd membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-li ne basis over the twelve -month card membership period as Net Card Fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (refer to Note 10). Other Fees and Com missions Other fees and commissions represent Card Member delinquency fees, foreign currency conversion fees, loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are char ged to the Card Member (refer to Note 19). In addition, service fees are also earned from other customers (e.g., merchants) for a variety of services and are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged. Als o included are fees related to the Company\u2019s Membership Rewards program, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year; the unamortized portion of which is included in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets ( r efer to Note 10). Contra-revenue The Company regularly makes payments through contractual arrangements with merchants, corporate payments clients, Card Members , third-party issuing partners and certain other customers. These payments, including cash rebates and statement credits provided to Card Members, are generally classified as contra-revenue unless a specifically identifiable benefit (e.g., goods or services) is received by the Company or its Card Members in consideration for that payment, a nd the fair value of such benefit is determinable and measurable. If such conditions are met, then the payment is classified as expense up to the estimated fair value of the benefit. If no such benefit is identified, then the entire payment is classified a s contra-revenue and included in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the revenue line item where the related transactions are recorded (e.g., Discount revenue or Other fees and commissions). Interest Income Interest on Card Member loans is assessed using the average daily balance method. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding, in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement, until the outstanding balance is pai d, or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relate to the Company\u2019s performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security prem iums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on the investment security\u2019s outstanding balance. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments wi ll not be made as scheduled. Interest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess of near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and o ther interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Interest Expense Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expe nse is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on the Company\u2019s long-term debt and shor t-term borrowings, as well as the realized impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk on the Company\u2019s long-term debt. Expenses Marketing and promotion expense includes costs incurred in the development and initial placement of advertising, wh ich are expensed in the year in which the advertising first takes place. Balance Sheet Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank balances, including securities purchased under resale agreements, and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company allocates goodwill to its reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business that is one level below an operating segment, for which discrete financial information is regul arly reviewed by the operating segment manager. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of the Co mpany\u2019s reporting units below its carrying value. Prior to completing the assessment of goodwill for impairment, the Company also performs a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than the carrying values. Alternatively, the Company performs a more detailed quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. This qualitative assessment entails the evaluation of factors such as economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit - specific events. If the Co mpany determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it then performs the impairment evaluation using the quantitative a ssessment . Under the quantitative assessment , t he first step ide ntifies whether there is a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then a test is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized based on the amount that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value. When measuring the fair value of its reporting units in the quantitative assessment , the Company uses wi dely accepted valuation techniques, applying a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples). When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, the Company uses internal forecasts to e stimate future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. To discount these cash flows, the Company uses the expected cost of equity, determined by using a capital asset pricing model. The Company believes the discount rates used appropria tely reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in the Company\u2019s internally - developed forecasts. When using market multiples under the market approach, the Company applies comparable publicly traded companies\u2019 m ultiples (e.g., earnings or revenues) to its reporting units\u2019 actual results. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units exceeded their carrying values. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company performed the quantitative assessment for all of its reporting units and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets, prima rily customer relationships, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 22 years. The Company reviews long-lived assets and asset groups, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the asset or asset group\u2019s fair value. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment, including leaseh old improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred during construction are capitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estim ated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years for equipment, furniture and building improvements, and from 40 to 50 years for premises, which are depreciated based upon their estimated useful l ife at the acquisition date. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility, or the economic life of the improvement, and ranges from 5 to 10 years. The Company maintains operating leases worldwide for facilities and equipment. Rent expense for facility leases is recognized ratably over the lease term, and includes adjustments for rent concessions, rent escalations and leasehold improvement all owances. The Company recognizes lease restoration obligations at the fair value of the restoration liabilities when incurred and amortizes the restoration assets over the lease term. Certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal- use software are also capitalized and recorded in Premises and equipment. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software\u2019s estimated useful life, generally 5 years. The Compa ny reviews these assets for impairment using the same impairment methodology used for its intangible assets.

The accounting standard establishes the principles to apply to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition, specifying the accounting for certain costs related to revenue, and requiring additional disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and related cash flows. The guidance, as amended and effective January 1, 2018, supersedes most of the r evenue recognition requirements in effect prior to that date . Beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2018, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements will reflect the adoption of the standard using the full retrosp ective method, which applies the new standard to each prior reporting period presented. The most significant impacts of the adoption are changes to the presentation of certain credit and charge card related costs that previously were netted against D iscoun t revenue, including Card Member cash-back reward costs and statement credits, corporate client incentive payments, as well as payments to third-party card issuing partners. Under the new standard , these costs are not considered components of the transacti on price of our card acceptance agreements with merchants and thus are not netted against Discount revenue , but instead recognized as expense s . Our p ayments to third-party card issuing partners will be presented net of related Other revenues earned from th e partners. These reclassifications are expected to have the following impacts to the reported re sults for the fiscal years ended : Increase (Decrease) December 31 (Millions) 2017 2016 Revenues Discount revenue $ 3,707 $ 3,699 Other (278) (253) Expenses Marketing and promotion 2,350 2,420 Card Member rewards $ 1,079 $ 1,026 The a doption of the new guidance also results in changes to the recognition timing of certain revenues, the impact of which is not material to net income. Similarly, t he adoption does not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets or statements of cash flows. T he Company is in the process of implementing changes to its accounting policies, business processes, systems and internal controls to support the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements under the new standard. I n January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities , which was effective and adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2018 . The guidance makes targeted changes to GAAP ; spe cifically to the classification and measurement of equity securities, and to certain disclosure requirements associated with the fai r value of financial assets and liabilities . In the ordinary course of business, the Company makes investments in non-public companies, which historically were recognized under the cost method of accounting. Under the new guidance, these investments are prospectively adjusted for observable price changes through earnings upon the identification of identical or similar transact ions of the same issuer. The adoption o f the guidance, as of January 1, 2018, did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of opera tions and cash flows. T he Company implemented changes to its accounting polic ies, business pro cesses and internal controls in support of the new guidance. In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on leases. The guidance, effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, requires virtually all leases to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2019, and is currently planning on using the modified retrospective approach, which requires recording existing operating leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets upon a doption and in the comparative period. The Company is in the process of upgrading its lease administration software and changing business processes and internal controls in preparation for the adoption. Specifically, the Company is currently reviewing its lease portfolio and is evaluating and interpreting the requirements under the guidance, including the available accounting policy elections, in o rder to determine the impacts on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows upon ad option. In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The guidance introduces a new credit reserving model know n as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model, which is based on expected losses, and differs significantly from the incurred loss approach used today. The CECL model requires measurement of expected credit losses not only based on historical experien ce and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. In addition, for available-for-sale debt securities, the new guidance replaces the other-than-temporary impairment model, and r equires the recognition of an allowance for reductions in a security\u2019s fair value attributable to declines in credit quality , instead o f a direct write-down of the security when a valuation dec line was determined to be other- than - temporary. T he guidance also requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption. The Company does not intend to adopt the new standard early and is currently evaluating the impact the new guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows; however, it is expected that the CECL model will alter the assumptions used in estimating credit losses on Card Member loans and receivables, and may result in material increases to the Company\u2019s credit reserves as the new guidance involves earlier recognition of expected losses for the life of the assets. The Company has established an enterprise-wide, cross-discipline governance structure to implement the new standard, and continues t o identify and conclude on key interpretive issues along with evaluating its existing credit loss forecasting models and processes in relation to the new guidance to determine what modifications may be required. In August 2017, the FASB issued new accounti ng guidance providing targeted improvements to the accounting f or hedging activities, effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted in any interim period or fiscal year before the effective date. The guidance introduces a number of amendments, s everal of which are optional, that are designed to simplify the application of hedge accounting, improve financial statement transparency and more closely align hedge accounting with an entity\u2019s risk management strategies. Effective January 1, 2018, t he Co mpany adopt ed the guidance , with no material impact on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows, along with associated changes to its accounting policies, business processes and internal controls in support of the new guidance. In February 2018, as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the reclassification of certain tax effects from AOCI to retained earnings. The optional guidance is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating whether it will adopt the new guidance along with any impacts on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows, none of which are expected to be material. Class ification of Various Items Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation. Specifically, d uring 2016, the Company determined that in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the comparat ive periods ended June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, certain activities related to long-term debt repayments were misclassified between financing activities and operating activities. There is no impact to the Consolidated Statements o f Income or Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company evaluated the effects of these misclassifications and concluded that none are material to any of its previously issued Cons olidated Financial Statements. Nevertheless, the Company elected to revise prosp ectively the comparative periods mentioned above. For the year ended December 31, 2015, this revision resulted in a $361 million decrease to both Net cash used in financing activities and Net cash provided by operating activities. In addition, travel commi ssions and fees, which were previously disclosed separately on the Consolidated Statements of Income, are now included within Other fees and commissions."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["NOTE 13 Contingencies and commitments Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various pending and potential legal actions, arbitration proceedings, claims, investigations, examinations, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations (collectively, legal proceedings). The Company discloses its material legal proceedings under Part I, Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings . \u201d In additio n to the matters disclosed under \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d the Company is being challenged in a number of countries regarding its application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain of its international transactions, which are in various stages of audit, or are b eing contested in legal actions (collectively, VAT matters). While the Company believes it has complied with all applicable tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that the Company owes additional VA T. In certain jurisdictions where the Company is contesting the assessments, it was required to pay the VAT assessments prior to contesting. The Company\u2019s legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of p utative class members. These legal proceedings involve various lines of business of the Company and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, common law tort, contract, application of tax laws, antitrust and consumer protection claims), some of w hich present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. While some matters pending against the Company specify the damages claimed by the plaintiff or class, many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal p rocess. Even when the amount of damages claimed against the Company are stated, the claimed amount may be exaggerated and/or unsupported. As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factu al information and legal issues to enable the Company to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss, while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that the Company is able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss. The Company has recorded reserves for certain of its outstanding legal proceedings. A reserve is recorded when it is both (a) probable that a loss has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the recorded reserve. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the reserve that has been previously recorded, or a revision to the disclosed est imated range of possible losses, as applicable. For those disclosed material legal proceedings and VAT matters where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related reserve for legal or tax contingencies or where there is n o such reserve, and for which the Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $ 500 million in excess of any reserves related to those matters. This range represents management\u2019s estimate based on currently available information and does not represent the Company\u2019s maximum loss exposure; actual results may vary significantly. As such leg al proceedings evolve, the Company may need to increase its range of possible loss or reserves. Based on its current knowledge, and taking into consideration its litigation-related liabilities, the Company believes it is not a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, it is possible that the outcome of le gal proceedings, including the possible resolution of merchant claims, could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations . COMMITMENTS The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under non-cancelable and cancelable agreements, for which total rental expense was $ 151 million, $ 169 million and $ 187 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. As of December 31, 2017 , the minimum aggregate rental commitment under all non-cancelable operating leases (net of subleases of $ 20 million) was as follows: (Millions) 2018 $ 131 2019 124 2020 98 2021 72 2022 57 Thereafter 831 Total $ 1,313 As of December 31, 2017 , the Company\u2019s future minimum lease payments under capital leases or other similar arrangements is approximately $ 4 million per annum in 201 8 through 202 0 , $ 2 million in 202 1, $ 1 million in 2022 and $ 10 million in aggregate thereafter. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $5.6 billion in commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners under which it makes payments based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresp onding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained .

Prior periods have been restated to conform to the new reportable operating segments, which are as follows: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS ) issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards and provides services to consumers in the United S tates, including consumer travel services ; International Consumer and Network Services (ICNS) issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards outside the United States and enters into partnership agreements with third-party card issuers and acquirers, li censing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network. It also provides travel services to consumers outside the United States ; Global Commercial Services (GCS) issues a wide range of proprietary corporate and small business card s and provides payment and expense management services globally. In addition, GCS provides commercial financing products ; and Global Merchant Services (GMS) operates a global payments network that processes and settles proprietary and non-proprietary card transactions. GMS acquires merchants and provides multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and data analytics, leveraging the Company\u2019s global closed-loop network. GMS also operates loyalty coalition businesses in certain countries arou nd the world. Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations, including the Company\u2019s Prepaid Services business and the American Express Global Business Travel (GBT) operations up to June 30, 2014, and subsequent activities related to the GBT JV , are included in Corporate & Other. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. The Company consolidates entities in which it holds a \u201ccontrolling financial interest.\u201d For voting interest entities, the Company is considered to hold a controlling financial interest when it is able to exercise c ontrol over the investees\u2019 operating and financial decisions. For variable interest entities (VIEs), the determination of which is based on the amount and characteristics of the entity\u2019s equity, the Company is considered to hold a controlling financial int erest when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the party that has both: (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact that VIE \u2019s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Entities in which the Company\u2019s voting interest in common equity does not provide it with control, but allows the Company to exert significant influence over t he operating and financial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method. All other investments in equity securities, to the extent they are not considered marketable securities, are accounted for under the cost method. Foreign Currency Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period ; r evenues and expenses are translated at the average month-end exchange rates during the year. R esulting translation adjustments, along with any related qualifying hedge and tax effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), a component of shareholders\u2019 equity. Translation adjustments, including qualifying hedge and tax effect s, are reclassified to earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of investments in foreign operations. Gains and losses related to transactions in a currency other than the functional currency are reported net in Other expenses, in the Company\u2019s Co nsolidated Statements of Income . N et foreign currency transaction losses amounted to approximately $ 18 million in 2016 , and n et foreign currency transaction gains amounted to approximately $ 68 million and $ 44 million in 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Amounts Based on Estimates and Assumptions Accounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management\u2019s assumptions concerning future events. Amon g the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member losses on loans and receivables, the proprietary point liability for Membership Rewards costs, fair value measurement s , goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. Income statement Discount Revenue Discount revenue generally represents the amount earned by the Company on transactions occurring at merchants with which the Company, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner, has entered into a card acceptance agreement for facilitating transactions between the merchants and the Company\u2019s Card Members. The amount of fees charged, or merchant discount, is generally deduct ed from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time a Card Member enters into a point-of-sale transaction with a merchant . Where the Company acts as the merchant acquirer and the card presented at a merchant is issued by a thir d-party financial institution, such as in the case of GNS partners, the Company makes financial settlement to the merchant and receives the discount revenue. In the Company\u2019s role as the operator of the card network, it also receives financial settlement f rom the GNS card issuer, which in turn receives an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and the Company. The difference between the merchant discount the Company receives from the merchant (which is directly agreed between a merc hant and the Company and is not based on the issuer rate) and the issuer rate r eceived by the GNS card issuer is recorded as discount revenue. In cases where the Company is the card issuer and the merchant acquirer is a third party (which can be the case in a country in which an Independent Operator partner is the local merchant acquirer or in the United States under our OptBlue program with certain third-party merchant acquirers), the Company receives a network rate in its settlement with the merchant acq uirer, which is individually negotiated between the Company and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue. In contrast with networks such as those operated by Visa Inc. and MasterC ard Incorporated , there are no collectively set interchange rates on the American Express network, issuer rates do not serve as a basis for merchant discount rates and no fees are agreed or due between the third-party financial institution participants on the network. Net Card Fees Net card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which varies based on the type of card and the n umber of cards for each account. These fees, net of deferred acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellation s , are deferred and rec ognized on a straight-line basis over the 12-month card membership period as Net Card Fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (refer to Note 10) . Other Fees and Commissions Other fees and commissions represent foreign currency conversion fees, Card Member delinquency fees, loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member (refer to Note 19). In addition, service fees are also earned from other customers (e.g., merchants) for a variety of services and are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged. Also included are fees related to the Company\u2019s Membership Rewards program, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year ; t he unamortized portion of which is included in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (Refer to Note 10). Contra-revenue The Company regularly makes payments through contractual arrangements with merchants, corporate payments clients, Card Members and certain other customers. These payments, including cash rebat es and statement credits provided to Card Members, are generally classified as contra-revenue unless a specifically identifiable benefit (e.g., goods or services) is received by the Company or its Card Members in consideration for that payment, and the fai r value of such benefit is determinable and measurable. If such conditions are met , then the payment is classified as expense up to the estimated fair value of the benefit. If no such benefit is identified, then the entire payment is classified as contra-r evenue and included in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the revenue line item where the related transactions are re corded (e.g., Discount revenue or Other fees and commissions). Interest Income Interest on Card Member loans is assessed using the average daily balance method. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding, in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement, until the outstanding balance is paid , or writ ten off. Interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relate to the Company\u2019s performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and d iscounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on the investment security\u2019s outstanding balance. Amounts are recognized until securit ies are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess of near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other inter est-bearing demand and call accounts. Interest Expense Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is div ided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on t he Company\u2019s long-term debt and short-term bor rowings, as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on the Company\u2019s long-term debt. Expenses Marketing and promotion expense includes advertising costs, which are expensed in the year in which the advertising first takes pla ce. Balance Sheet Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank balances, including securities purchased under resale agreements, and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company allocates goodwill to its reporting units for the purpose of imp airment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business that is one level below an operating segment , for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by the operating segment manager. The Company evaluates goodwil l for impairment annually as of June 30, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of the Company\u2019s reporting units below its carrying value. The Company performs an impa irment evaluation of goodwill using a two-step process. The first step identifies whether there is a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized based on the amount that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value. Prior to completing the interim assessment of goodwill for impairment under the second step, the Company performs a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets by assessing the rec overability of the assets based on the cash flows generated by the relevant ass ets or asset groups. I f the sum of undiscounted cash flow exceeds the carrying value , an impairment loss is recognized based on the amount that the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See further details in Other Intangible A ssets herein. Goodwill impairment testing involves management judgment, requiring an assessment of whether the carrying val ue of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value . U sing widely accepted valuation techniques, t he Company appli es a combination of th e income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) to measure the fair values of its reporting units . When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, the Company uses internal forecasts to estimate futur e cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. To discount these cash flows, the Company uses the expected cost of equity, determined by using a capital asset pricing model. The Company believes the discount rates used appropriately reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in the Company\u2019s internally developed forecasts. When using market multiples under the market approach, the Company applies comparable publicly traded compan ies\u2019 multiples (e.g ., earnings or revenues) to its reporting units\u2019 actual results. Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 22 years . The Company reviews long-lived assets and asset groups, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the asset or asset group\u2019s fair value. Certain long-lived assets, such as capitalized software development costs, are included in Premises and equipment. The Company reviews these assets for impairment using the same impairment methodology used for intangible assets. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred during construction are capitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years for equipment, furniture and building improvements , and from 40 to 50 years for p remises , which are depreciated based upon their estimated useful life at the acquisition date. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility , or the economic life of the improvement, and ranges from 5 to 10 years. The Company maintains operating leases worldwide for facilities and equipment. Rent expense for facility leases is recognized ratably over the lease term, and inc ludes adjustments for rent concessions, rent escalations and leasehold improvement allowances. The Company recognizes lease restoration obligations at the fair value of the restoration liabilities when incurred and amortizes the restoration assets over the lease term. Certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software are also recorded in Premises and equipment. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the sof tware\u2019s estimated useful life, generally 5 years.

The accounting standard establishes the principles to apply to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition, specifying the accounting for certain costs related to revenue, and requiring additional disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue s and related cash flows. The guidance, as amended, supersedes most of the current revenue recognition requirements, and is effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption as of January 1, 2017 . The Company will adopt the new guidance on January 1, 2018 , and anticipates using the full retrospective method , which applies the new standard to each prior reporting period presented. T he Company has been working on the implementation of th e standard since its issuance in 2014 and has made significant p rogress in evaluat ing the potential impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. There will be changes to the recognition timing and classification of revenues and expenses; however, the Company does not expect a significant impact to pretax income up on adoption . The Company is also in the process of implementing changes to its accounting policies, business processes, systems and internal controls to support the recognition and disclosure requirements under the new standard. In January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The guidance, which is effective January 1, 2018, makes targeted changes to current GAAP, specifically to the classification and measurement of equity securities, and to certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The Company continues to evaluate the impact this guidance will have on its financial position, resul ts of operations and cash flows. I n preparation for the implementation , the Company is evaluating the impact the guidance will have on its cost method investments, as well as the impact the standard will have on its accounting policies, business processes, systems and internal controls. In F ebruary 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on leases. The guidance, which is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, requires virtually all leases to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company currently antic ipates adopting the standard effective January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach , which requires recording existing operating leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets upon adoption and in the comparative period. The Company is in the proc ess of identifying changes to it s accounting policies, business processes , systems, and internal controls in preparation for the implementation . Specifically, the Company is currently reviewing its lease portfolio, including service contracts that may incl ude embedded leases, and is evaluating and interpreting the requirements under the guidance, including the available accounting policy elections and practical expedients upon transition, in order to determine the impacts to the Company\u2019s financial position , results of operat ions and cash flows upon adoption. In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on employee shar e-based payments, adopted by the Company effective January 1, 2017, which simplifies various aspects of the accounting for share-b ased payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, accounting for award forfeitures, and classification on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Among other items, the guidance requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies, which under previous guidance would have been recorded within additional paid-in capital, to now be recognized in the income tax provision within the results of operations. The adoption of the guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s financial posit ion, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, which is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The guidance in troduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model, which is based on expected losses, and differs significantly from the incurred loss approach used today. The CECL model requires measurement of expected credit lo sses not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information and will likely result in earlier recognition of credit reserves. The Company does not intend to adopt the new standard early and is currently evaluating the impact the new guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows; however, it is expected that the new CECL model will alter the assumptions used in estim ating credit losses on Card Member loans and receivables, among other financial instruments (e.g., investments in available-for-sale debt securities) , and may result in material changes to the Company\u2019s credit reserves. Classification of Various Items Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation. During 2016, the Company determined that in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the comparative periods ended June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, certain activities related to long-term debt repayments were misclassified between financing activities and operating activities. There is no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Balance Sheets. T he Company has evaluated the effects of these misclassifications and concluded that none are material to any of its previously is sued Consolidated Financial Statements. Nevertheless, the Company has elected to revise prospectively the comparative periods mentioned above. For the year ended Dec ember 3 1 , 2015, this revision resulted in a $ 361 million decrease to both Net cash used in financing activities and Net cash provided by operating activities. In addition, travel commissions and fees, which were previ ously disclosed separately on the Consolidated S tatements of Income , are now included within Other fees and commissions."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Contingencies": ["NOTE 13 C ontingencies and c ommitments Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various pending and potential legal actions, arbitration proceedings, claims, investigations, examinations, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations (collectively, legal proceedings). The Company discloses its material legal proceedings under Part I, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d. In addition to the matters disclosed under \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d the Company is being challenged in a number of countries regarding its app lication of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain of its international transactions, which are in various stages of audit , or are be ing contest ed in legal actions (collectively, VAT matters ). While the Company believes it has complied with all applicable tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that the Company owes additional VAT . In certain jurisdictions where the Company is contesting the assessments, it was required to pay the VAT assessments prior to contesting. The Company\u2019s legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of pu tative class members. These legal proceedings involve various lines of business of the Company and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, common law tort, contract, application of tax laws, antitrust and consumer protection claims), some of wh ich present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. While some matters pending against the Company specify the damages claimed by the plaintiff or class, many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal pr ocess. Even when the amount of damages claimed against the Company are stated, the claimed amount may be exaggerated and/or unsupported. As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factua l information and legal issues to enable the Company to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss, while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that the Company is able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss. The C ompany has recorded reserves for certain of its outstanding legal proceedings. A reserve is recorded when it is both (a) probable that a loss has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There may be instances in which an exposure t o loss exceeds the recorded reserve. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the reserve that has been previously recorded, or a revision to the disclosed esti mated range of possible losses, as applicable. For those disclosed material legal proceedings and VAT matter s where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related reserve for legal or tax contingencies or where there is no such reserve, and for which the Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $440 million in excess of any reserves related to those matters. This range represents management\u2019s estimate based on currently av ailable information and does not represent the Company\u2019s maximum loss exposure; actual results may vary significantly. As such legal proceedings evolve , the Company may need to increase its range of possible loss or reserves. Based on its current knowledg e, and taking into consideration its litigation-related liabilities, the Company believes it is not a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated finan cial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings, including the possible resolution of merchant claims, could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations . COMMITMENTS The Company also has obligations to make payments under contractual agreements with certain cobrand partners. The Company expects to fully satisfy these obligations over the remaining term of these agreements as part of the ongoi ng operations of its business. As of December 31, 2016 , the obligations under such arrangements were as follows : (Millions) 2017 $ 72 2018 58 2019 46 2020 33 2021 169 Thereafter 10 Total $ 388 The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under non-cancelable and cancelable agreements, for which total rental expense was $ 169 million, $ 187 million and $ 237 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. As of December 31, 2016 , the minimum aggregate rental commitment under all non-cancelable operating leases (net of subleases of $ 17 million) was as follows: (Millions) 2017 $ 127 2018 108 2019 91 2020 69 2021 49 Thereafter 788 Total $ 1,232 As of December 31, 2016 , the Company\u2019s future minimum lease payments under capital leases or other similar arrangements is approximately $ 4 million per annum in 201 7 through 202 0 , $ 1 million in 20 21 and $ 10 million in aggregate thereafter.

These undrawn amounts support contingent funding needs. The availability of the credit line is subject to the Company\u2019s compliance with certain financial covenants, principally the maintenance by American Express Credit Corporation (Credco) of a 1.25 ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges, to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Company was not in violation of any of its debt covenants. Additionally, the Company maintained a 3-year committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility that gives the Compan y the right to sell up to $ 3.0 billion face amount of eligible notes issued from the Charge T rust at any time through July 16 , 2018. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , $ 3.0 billion and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, were draw n on this facility. The Company paid $ 11.5 million and $ 35.1 million in fees to maintain these lines in 2016 and 2015 , respectively. These committed facilities do not contain material adverse change clauses, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facilities, nor are they dependent on the Company\u2019s credit rating. The Company paid total interest, primarily related to short- and long-term debt, corresponding interest rate swaps and customer deposits, of $ 1.7 billion, $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.7 billion in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively."]}, "external_audit": "independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report appearing on the following page on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. \n\n\u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000119312517047588/d321397d10k.htm"}, "2015": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Basis of Presentation": ["NOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The Company American Express Company (the Company) is a global service s company that provides customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. The Company\u2019s principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered t o consumers and businesses around the world. Business travel-related services are offered through the non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Business Travel (GBT JV). Prior to July 1, 2014, these business travel operations were wholly own ed. The Company\u2019s various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various chan nels, including direct mail, on li ne applications, in-house and third-party sales forces a nd direct response advertising. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. The Company consolidates entities in which it holds a \u201ccontrolling financial interest.\u201d For voting interest entities, the Company is considered to hold a controll ing financial interest when it is able to exercise control over the investees\u2019 operating and financial decisions. For variable interest entities (VIEs), the Company is considered to hold a controlling financial interest when it is determined to be the prim ary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the party that has both: (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact that entity\u2019s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE is based on the amount and characteristics of the entity\u2019s equity. Entities in which the Company\u2019s voting interest in common equity does not provide i t with control, but allows the Company to exert significant influence over the operating and financial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method. All other investments in equity securities, to the extent they are not considered marketable securi ties, are accounted for under the cost method. Foreign Currency Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. The resulting translation adjustments, along with any related qualifying hedge and tax effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), a component of shareholders\u2019 equity. Translation adjustments, including qualifying hedge and tax effects, are reclas sified to earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of investments in foreign operations. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average month-end exchange rates during the year. Gains and losses related to transactions in a currency other tha n the functional currency are reported net in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income, in other non-interest revenue, interest income, interest expense, or other expenses, depending on the nature of the activity. Net foreign currency transaction ga ins amounted to approximately $ 68 million, $ 44 million and $ 108 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Amounts Based on Estimates and Assumptions Accounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management\u2019s assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member losses on loans and receivables, the proprietary point liability for Membership Rewards costs, fair value measurement, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. Income statement Discount Revenue Discount revenue represents the amount earned by the Company on transactions occurring at merchants with which the Company, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner, has entered into a card acceptance agreement for facilitating transactions between the merchants and the Company\u2019s Card Members. The discount fee generally is deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the charge is captured. Net Card Fees Card fees, net of deferred acquisition costs and a reserve for projected r efunds for Card Member cancellation, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 12-month card membership period as Net Card Fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other Liabilit ies on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (refer to Note 10). Travel Commissions and Fees The Company earns travel commissions and fees by charging clients transaction or management fees for selling and arranging travel. Client transaction fee revenue is recognized at the time the client books the travel arrangements. The Company\u2019s travel suppliers (e.g., airlines, hotels and car rental companies) pay commissions and fees on tickets issued, sales and other services based o n contractual agreements. Commissions and fees from travel suppliers are generally recognized at the time a ticket is purchased or over the term of the contract, if not transaction specific. Commissions and fees that are based on services rendered (e.g., h otel stays and car rentals) are recognized based on usage. Other Commissions and Fees Other commissions and fees include foreign currency conversion fees, Card Member delinquency fees, service fees and other card-related assessments, which are recognize d primarily in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member (refer to Note 19). In addition, service fees are also earned from other customers (e.g., merchants) for a variety of services and are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged. Also included are fees related to the Company\u2019s Membership Rewards program, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, generally one year. The unamortized Membership Rewards fee balanc e is included in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (Refer to Note 10). Contra-revenue The Company regularly makes payments through contractual arrangements with merchants, corporate payments clients, Card Members and certain other cust omers. These payments, including cash rebates and statement credits provided to Card Members, are generally classified as contra-revenue unless a specifically identifiable benefit (e.g., goods or services) is received by the Company or its Card Members in consideration for that payment, and the fair value of such benefit is determinable and measurable. If no such benefit is identified, then the entire payment is classified as contra-revenue and included in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the revenu e line item where the related transactions are recorded (e.g., Discount revenue, Travel commissions and fees, and Other commissions and fees). If such a benefit is identified, then the payment is classified as expense up to the estimated fair value of the benefit. Interest Income Interest on Card Member loans is assessed using the average daily balance method. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding, in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement, until the outstanding balance is paid or written off. Interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relate to the Company\u2019s performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on the investment security\u2019s outstanding balance. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess of near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. Interest Expense Interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member receivables and loans, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: ( i ) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily rel ates to interest expense on the Company\u2019s long-term financing and short-term borrowings, as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on the Company\u2019s long-term debt. Expenses Marketing and promotion expense includes advertisi ng costs, which are expensed in the year in which the advertising first takes place. Balance Sheet Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank balances, including securities purchase d under resale agreements, and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company allocates goodwill to its reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business that is one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is regula rly reviewed by the operating segment manager. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of the Comp any\u2019s reporting units below its carrying value. The Company performs an impairment evaluation of goodwill using a two-step process. The first step identifies whether there is a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the car rying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized based on the amount t hat the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value. Prior to completing the interim assessment of goodwill for impairment under the second step, the Company performs a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets by assessing the recove rability of the asset values based on the cash flows generated by the relevant assets or asset groups . If the assets are not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based on the amount that the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its f air value. See further details in Other Intangible Assets herein. Goodwill impairment testing involves management judgment, requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by its fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques. The Company uses a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples). When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, the Company uses internal forecasts to estim ate future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. To discount these cash flows, the Company uses the expected cost of equity, determined by using a capital asset pricing model. The Company believes the discount rates used appropriately reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in the Company\u2019s internally developed forecasts. When using market multiples under the market approach, the Company applies comparable publicly traded companies\u2019 multi ples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to its reporting units\u2019 actual results. Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 22 years on a straight-line basis . The Company reviews long-lived assets and asset groups, including intangible assets , for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recove rable and exceeds the asset or asset group\u2019s fair value. Certain long-lived assets, such as capitalized software development costs, are included in Premises and equipment. The Company reviews these assets for impairment using the same impairment methodology used for intangible assets. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred during construction are capitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years for equipment, furniture and building improvements. Premises are depreciated based upon their estimated useful life at the acquisition date, which generally ranges from 40 to 50 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining term o f the leased facility or the economic life of the improvement, which ranges from 5 to 10 years. The Company maintains operating leases worldwide for facilities and equipment. Rent expense for facility leases is recognized ratably over the lease term, and includes adjustments for rent concessions, rent escalations and leasehold improvement allowances. The Company recognizes lease restoration obligations at the fair value of the restoration liabilities when incurred, and amortizes the res toration assets over the lease term. Certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software are also recorded in Premises and equipment. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight -line basis over the software\u2019s estimated useful life, generally 5 years.

The guidance establishes the principles to apply to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition, specifying the accounting for certain costs related to revenue, and requiring additional disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and related cash flows. The guidance, as amended, supersedes most of the current revenue recognition requirements, and is effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption as of January 1, 2017, permitted . The Company does not intend to adopt the new standard early and continues to evaluate the impact this guidance, including the method of implementation, will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows, among other items . In January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the recognition and measure ment of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard, which is effective January 1, 2018, makes targeted changes to current GAAP, specifically to the classification and measurement of equity securities, and to certain disclosure requirements as sociated with the fair value of financial instruments. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations a nd cash flows, among other items . Classification of Various Items In the first quarter of 2015, the Company changed the classification related to certain payments to partners, reducing both discount revenue and marketing and promotion expense. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. None of the prior period financial statements were materially misstated from these misclassifications. Certain other insignificant reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation."]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Contingencies": ["NOTE 13 Commitments and Contingencies Legal Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various claims, investigations, examinations, pending and potential legal actions, and other matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations (collectively, legal proceedings). The Company discloses its material legal proceedings under \u201cLegal Proceedings \u201d. The Company has recorded reserves for certain of its outstanding legal proceedings. A reser ve is record ed when it is both (a) probable that a loss has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the recorded reserve. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, deve lopments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the reserve that has been previously recorded, or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses, as applicable. The Company\u2019s legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members. These legal proceedings involve various lines of business of the Company and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, common law tort, contract, a ntitrust and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. While some matters pending against the Company specify the damages claimed by the plaintiff or class, many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process. Even when the amount of damages claimed against the Company are stated, the claimed amount may be exaggerated and/or unsupported. As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently thro ugh discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable the Company to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss , while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that the Company is able to estimate a n amount of loss or a range of possible loss . For those disclosed material legal proceedings where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related reserve for legal contingencies or where there is no such reserve , and for w hich the Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $ 350 million in excess of any reserves related to these matters. This range represents management\u2019s estimate based on currently available information and does not represent the Company\u2019s maximum loss exposure; actual results may vary significantly. As such proceedings evolve, including the merchant claims described under \u201cLegal Proceedings , \u201d the Company may need to increase its range of possible loss o r reserves for legal contingencies. Based on its current knowledge, and taking into consideration its litigation-related liabilities, the Company believes it is not a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings, including the possible resolution of merch ant claims, could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. OTHER COMMITMENTS The Company also has obligations to make payments under contractual agreements with certain cobrand partners. The Company expects to fully satisfy these obligations over the remaining term of these agreements as part of the ongoing operations of its business. As of December 31, 2015 , the obligations under such arrangements were as follows : (Millions) 2016 $ 212 2017 76 2018 62 2019 43 2020 20 Thereafter 204 Total $ 617 The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under non-cancelable and cancelable agreements, for which total rental expense was $ 187 million, $ 237 million and $ 281 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , the minimum aggregate rental commitment under all non-cancelable operating leases (net of subleases of $ 37 million) was as follows: (Millions) 2016 $ 165 2017 149 2018 129 2019 105 2020 82 Thereafter 863 Total $ 1,493 As of December 31, 2015 , the Company\u2019s future minimum lease payments under capital leases or other similar arrangements is approximately $ 4 million in 2016 through 2020 , and $ 14 million thereafter.

Under fair value hedge accounting, the outstanding balances on these fixed-rate notes are adjusted to reflect the impact of changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates. Refer to No te 14 for more details on the Company\u2019s treatment of fair value hedges. For floating-rate issuances, the stated and effective interest rates are weighted based on the outstanding balances and floating rates in effect as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Effective interest rates are only presented when swaps are in place to hedge the underlying debt. For the $ 750 million of subordinated debentures issued in 2006 and outstanding as of December 31, 2015 , the maturity date will automatically be extended to September 1, 2066, except in the case of either ( i ) a prior redemption or (ii) a default. At the Company\u2019s option, the subordinated debentures are redeemable for cash on or after September 1, 2016, at 100 percent of the principal amounts plus an y accrued but unpaid interest. Includes $ 29 million and $ 31 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, related to capitalized lease transactions. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company had $ 750 million principal outstanding of Subordinated Debentures that accrue interest at an annual rate of 6.8 percent until September 1, 2016 , and at an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.23 percent thereafter. As noted above, at the Company\u2019s option, these Subordinated Debentures are redeemable for cash after September 1, 2016 at 100 percent of the principal amount plus any a ccrued but unpaid interest. The Company currently intends to exercise this redemption option subject to business and market conditions. If the Company fails to achieve specified performance measures, it will be required to issue common shares and apply the net proceeds to make interest payments on these Subordinated Debentures. No dividends on the Company\u2019s common or preferred shares could be paid until such interest payments are made. The Company would fail to meet these specific performance measures if ( i ) the Company\u2019s tangible common equity is less than 4 percent of total adjusted assets for the most recent quarter or (ii) if the trailing two quarters\u2019 consolidated net income is equal to or less than zero and tangible common equity as of the tr igger determination date, and as of the end of the quarter end six months prior, has in each case declined by 10 percent or more from tangible common equity as of the end of the quarter 18 months prior to the trigger determination date. T he Company met the specified performance measures in 2015 . The Company issued $ 600 million of 3.6 percent subordinated notes on December 5, 2014 that are senior in right of payment to the outstanding $ 750 million of Subordinated Deben tures. Aggregate annual maturities on long-term debt obligations (based on contractual maturity or anticipated redemption dates) as of December 31, 2015 were as follows: (Millions) 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Total American Express Company (Parent Company only) (a) $ 1,350 $ 1,500 $ 3,851 $ 641 $ \u2015 $ 3,147 $ 10,489 American Express Credit Corporation 4,931 4,900 3,614 4,150 4,150 \u2015 21,745 American Express Centurion Bank \u2015 1,300 125 \u2015 \u2015 \u2015 1,425 American Express Bank, FSB \u2015 1,300 \u2015 \u2015 \u2015 \u2015 1,300 American Express Charge Trust II \u2015 \u2015 2,287 \u2015 \u2015 \u2015 2,287 American Express Lending Trust 500 6,639 2,885 1,317 \u2015 \u2015 11,341 Other 33 83 124 4 \u2015 29 273 $ 6,814 $ 15,722 $ 12,886 $ 6,112 $ 4,150 $ 3,176 $ 48,860 Unamortized Underwriting Fees (96) Unamortized Discount and Premium (890) Impacts due to Fair Value Hedge Accounting 187 Total Long-Term Debt $ 48,061 The Company currently intends to exercise its redemption option related to the $750 million of Subordinated Debentures, subject to business and market conditions. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company maintained a bank line of credit of $ 3.0 billion compared to bank lines of credit of $ 6.7 billion as of December 31, 2014 . Of the total credit lines, $ 3.0 billion was undrawn as of both December 31, 2015 and 2014 . These undrawn amounts support commercial paper borrowi ngs and contingent funding needs. The availability of the credit line is subject to the Company\u2019s compliance with certain financial covenants, principally the maintenance by American Express Credit Corporation ( Credco ) of a 1.25 ratio of combined e arnings and fixed charges, to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company was not in violation of any of its debt covenants. Additionally, the Company maintained a 3-year committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility that gives th e Company the right to sell up to $ 3.0 billion face amount of eligible notes issued from the Charge Trust at any time through July 15, 2018. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , $ 1.0 billion and $ 2.5 billion, respectively, were drawn on this facility. The Company paid $ 35.1 million and $ 49.9 million in fees to maintain these lines in 2015 and 2014 , respectively. These committed facilities do not contain material adverse change clauses, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facilities, nor are they dependent on the Company\u2019s credit rating. The Company paid total interest, primarily related to short- and long-term debt, corresponding interest rate swaps and customer deposits, of $ 1.6 billion, $ 1.7 billion and $ 2.0 billion in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

(\u201cT-Mobile,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a leading provider of mobile communications services, including voice, messaging and data, under its flagship brands, T-Mobile and Metro\u2122 by T-Mobile (\"Metro by T-Mobile\"), in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Substantially all of our revenues were earned in, and substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in, the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We provide mobile communications services primarily using our 4G Long Term Evolution (\u201cLTE\u201d) network and our 5G technology network. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including handsets, tablets and other mobile communication devices, and accessories for sale, as well as financing through equipment installment plans (\u201cEIP\u201d) and leasing through JUMP! On Demand. We also provide reinsurance for device insurance policies and extended warranty contracts offered to our mobile communications customers. In addition to our wireless communications services, we offer fast and reliable High Speed Internet utilizing our nationwide 5G network. Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the balances and results of operations of T-Mobile and our consolidated subsidiaries. We consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, as well as variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and VIEs, which cannot be deconsolidated, such as those related to Tower obligations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. We operate as a single operating segment. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions which affect our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including, but not limited to, the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed through our merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d) with Sprint Corporation (\u201cSprint\u201d) and through our acquisitions of affiliates and the potential impacts arising from macroeconomic trends. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. On September 6, 2022, Sprint Communications LLC, a Kansas limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (\u201cSprint Communications\u201d), Sprint LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Cogent Infrastructure, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \u201cBuyer\u201d) and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc., entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the \u201cWireline Sale Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the Buyer will acquire the U.S. long-haul fiber network and operations (including the non-U.S. extensions thereof) of Sprint Communications and its subsidiaries (the \u201cWireline Business\u201d). Such transactions contemplated by the Wireline Sale Agreement are collectively referred to as the \u201cWireline Transaction.\u201d The assets and liabilities of the Wireline Business disposal group are classified as held for sale and presented within Other current assets and Other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022. The fair value of the Wireline Business disposal group, less costs to sell, will be reassessed during each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale, and any remeasurement to the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell will be reported as an adjustment included within Loss on disposal group held for sale on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Unless otherwise specified, the amounts and information presented in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements include assets and liabilities that have been reclassified as held for sale as of December 31, 2022. Business Combinations Assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset or liability. See Note 2 \u2013 Business Combinations for further discussion of the Merger between T-Mobile and Sprint and the acquisition of the wireless telecommunications assets (the \u201cWireless Assets\u201d) of Shenandoah Personal Communications Company LLC (\u201cShentel\u201d) used to provide Sprint PCS\u2019s wireless mobility communications network products in certain parts of Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia Kentucky, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Receivables and Related Allowance for Credit Losses Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable balances are predominantly comprised of amounts currently due from customers (e.g., for wireless communications services and monthly device lease payments), device insurance administrators, wholesale partners, other carriers and third-party retail channels. Accounts receivable are presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their amortized cost basis (i.e., the receivables\u2019 unpaid principal balance (\u201cUPB\u201d) as adjusted for any written-off amounts relating to impairment), net of the allowance for credit losses. We have an arrangement to sell certain of our customer service accounts receivable on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. Equipment Installment Plan Receivables We offer certain customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments, generally over a period of 24 months using an EIP. EIP receivables are presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their amortized cost basis (i.e., the receivables\u2019 UPB as adjusted for any written-off amounts due to impairment and unamortized discounts), net of the allowance for credit losses. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest if the term exceeds 12 months as there is no stated rate of interest on the receivables. The receivables are recorded at their present value, which is determined by discounting expected future cash payments at the imputed interest rate. This adjustment results in a discount or reduction in the transaction price of the contract with a customer, which is allocated to the performance obligations of the arrangement such as Service and Equipment revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The imputed discount rate reflects a current market interest rate and is predominately comprised of the estimated credit risk underlying the EIP receivable, reflecting the estimated credit worthiness of the customer. The imputed discount on receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as Other revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The current portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables, net and the long-term portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have an arrangement to sell certain EIP receivables on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. See Note 4 \u2013 Sales of Certain Receivables for further information. Additionally, certain of our EIP receivables included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets secure our asset-backed notes (\u201cABS Notes\u201d). See Note 8 \u2013 Debt for further information. Allowance for Credit Losses We maintain an allowance for credit losses by applying an expected credit loss model. Each period, management assesses the appropriateness of the level of allowance for credit losses by considering credit risk inherent within each portfolio segment as of period end. Each portfolio segment is comprised of pools of receivables that are evaluated collectively based on similar risk characteristics. Our allowance levels consider estimated credit risk over the contractual life of the receivables and are influenced by receivable volumes, receivable delinquency status, historical loss experience and other conditions that affect loss expectations, such as changes in credit and collections policies and forecasts of macroeconomic conditions. While we attribute portions of the allowance to our respective accounts receivable and EIP portfolio segments, the entire allowance is available to credit losses related to the total receivable portfolio. We consider a receivable past due and delinquent when a customer has not paid us by the contractually specified payment due date. Account balances are written off against the allowance for credit losses if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible (customer default), based on factors such as customer credit ratings as well as the length of time the amounts are past due. If there is a deterioration of our customers\u2019 financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we will adjust our allowance for credit losses accordingly. Inventories Inventories consist primarily of wireless devices and accessories, which are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using standard cost, which approximates average cost. Shipping and handling costs paid to wireless device and accessories vendors as well as costs to refurbish used devices are included in the standard cost of inventory. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of disposal and transportation. We record inventory write-downs to net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving items based on inventory turnover trends and historical experience. Deferred Purchase Price Assets In connection with the sales of certain service and EIP accounts receivable pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable Level 3 inputs, including estimated customer default rates and credit worthiness. See Note 4 \u2013 Sales of Certain Receivables for further information. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets include assets that do not have indefinite lives, such as property and equipment and certain intangible assets. Substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the U.S., including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indicators of impairment are present, we test recoverability. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the asset or asset group\u2019s carrying amount, then an impairment loss is recorded, measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. During the second quarter of 2022, we determined that the retirement of the legacy Sprint CDMA and LTE wireless networks triggered the need to separately assess the Wireline long-lived asset group for impairment and the results of this assessment indicated that certain Wireline long-lived assets were impaired. See Note 16 - Wireline for further information. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of buildings and equipment, wireless communications systems, leasehold improvements, capitalized software, leased wireless devices and construction in progress. Buildings and equipment include certain network server equipment. Wireless communications systems include assets to operate our wireless network and information technology data centers, including tower assets, leasehold improvements and asset retirement costs. Leasehold improvements include asset improvements other than those related to the wireless network. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments, if any, in Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit using the straight-line method. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book value is depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease term. Costs of major replacements and improvements are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures which do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Construction costs, labor and overhead incurred in the expansion or enhancement of our wireless network are capitalized. Capitalization commences with pre-construction period administrative and technical activities, which include obtaining zoning approvals and building permits, and ceases at the point at which the asset is ready for its intended use. We capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of certain property and equipment. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated over the useful life of the related assets. We record an asset retirement obligation for the estimated fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, we recognize changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. Our obligations relate primarily to certain legal obligations to remediate leased property on which our network infrastructure and administrative assets are located. We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or acquiring internal use software. Capitalization of software costs commences once the final selection of the specific software solution has been made and management authorizes and commits to funding the software project and ceases once the project is ready for its intended use. Capitalized software costs are included in Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. Device Leases Through the Merger, we acquired device lease contracts in which Sprint is the lessor (the \u201cSprint Flex Lease Program\u201d), substantially all of which are classified as operating leases, as well as the associated fixed assets (i.e., the leased devices). These leased devices were recorded as fixed assets at their acquisition date fair value and presented within Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Beginning in 2021, we discontinued offering the Sprint Flex lease program and are shifting customer device financing to EIP plans. Our leasing programs (\u201cLeasing Programs\u201d), which include JUMP! On Demand and the Sprint Flex Lease Program, allow customers to lease a device (handset or tablet) generally over an initial period of 18 months and upgrade the device with a new device when eligibility requirements are met. We depreciate leased devices to their estimated residual value, on a group basis, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the device. The estimated useful life reflects the period for which we estimate the group of leased devices will provide utility to us, which may be longer than the initial lease term based on customer options in the Sprint Flex Lease program to renew the lease on a month-to-month basis after the initial lease term concludes. In determining the estimated useful life, we consider the lease term (e.g., 18 months and month-to-month renewal options for the Sprint Flex Lease Program), trade-in activity and write-offs for lost and stolen devices. Lost and stolen devices are incorporated into the estimates of depreciation expense and recognized as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation when the loss event occurs. Our policy of using the group method of depreciation has been applied to acquired leased devices as well as leases originated subsequent to the Merger. Acquired leased devices are grouped based on the age of the device. Revenues associated with the leased devices, net of lease incentives, are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For arrangements in which we are the lessor of devices, we separate lease and non-lease components. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers in the JUMP! On Demand lease program must return or purchase their device, and customers in the Sprint Flex Lease Program have the option to return or purchase their device or to renew their lease on a month-to-month basis. The purchase price of the device is established at lease commencement and is based on the type of device leased and any down payment made. The Leasing Programs do not contain any residual value guarantees or variable lease payments, and there are no restrictions or covenants imposed by these leases. Returned devices, including those received upon device upgrade, are transferred from Property and equipment, net to Inventory on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with any write-down recognized as Cost of equipment sales on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets that do not have indefinite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Through the Merger, we acquired lease agreements (the \u201cAgreements\u201d) with various educational and non-profit institutions that provide us with the right to use Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) spectrum licenses (Educational Broadband Services or \u201cEBS spectrum\u201d) in the 2.5 GHz band. In addition to the Agreements with educational institutions and private owners who hold the licenses, we also acquired direct ownership of spectrum licenses previously acquired by Sprint through government auctions or other acquisitions. The Agreements with educational and certain non-profit institutions are typically for terms of five Leased FCC spectrum licenses are recorded as executory contracts whereby, as a result of business combination accounting, an intangible asset or liability is recorded reflecting the extent to which contractual terms are favorable or unfavorable to current market rates. These intangible assets or liabilities are amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the lease agreements. Contractual lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the arrangement, including renewals, and are presented in Costs of services on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Customer lists and the Sprint trade name are amortized using the sum-of-the-years digits method over the period in which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. Reacquired rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the Management Agreement (as defined in Note 2 \u2013 Business Combinations ), which represents the period of expected economic benefit. The remaining finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination and is assigned to our one reporting unit: wireless. Spectrum Licenses Spectrum licenses are carried at costs incurred to acquire the spectrum licenses and the costs to prepare the spectrum licenses for their intended use, such as costs to clear acquired spectrum licenses. The FCC issues spectrum licenses which provide us with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum within specific geographic service areas to provide wireless communications services. Spectrum licenses are issued for a fixed period of time, typically up to 15 years; however, the FCC has granted license renewals routinely and at a nominal cost. The spectrum licenses acquired expire at various dates and we believe we will be able to meet all requirements necessary to secure renewal of our spectrum licenses at a nominal cost. Moreover, we determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our spectrum licenses. The utility of radio frequency spectrum does not diminish while activated on our network nor does it otherwise deteriorate over time. Therefore, we determined the spectrum licenses should be treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets. At times, we enter into agreements to sell or exchange spectrum licenses. Upon entering into the arrangement, if the transaction has been deemed to have commercial substance, spectrum licenses are reviewed for impairment. The licenses are transferred at their carrying value, as adjusted for any impairment recognized, to assets held for sale, which is included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets until approval and completion of the exchange or sale. Upon closing of the transaction, spectrum licenses acquired as part of an exchange of nonmonetary assets are recorded at fair value and the difference between the fair value of the spectrum licenses obtained, carrying value of the spectrum licenses transferred and cash paid, if any, is recognized as a gain or loss on disposal of spectrum licenses included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Our fair value estimates of spectrum licenses are based on information for which there is little or no observable market data. If the transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value is not measurable, the acquired spectrum licenses are recorded at our carrying value of the spectrum assets transferred or exchanged. The spectrum licenses we hold plus the spectrum leases enhance the overall value of our spectrum licenses as the collective value is higher than the value of individual bands of spectrum within a specific geography. This value is derived from the ability to provide wireless service to customers across large geographic areas and maintain the same or similar wireless connectivity quality. This enhanced value from combining owned and leased spectrum licenses is referred to as an aggregation premium. The aggregation premium is a component of the overall fair value of our owned FCC spectrum licenses, which are recorded as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment We assess the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum license portfolio, for potential impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired. We test goodwill on a reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its book value. If the fair value exceeds the book value, then no impairment is measured. As of December 31, 2022, we have identified one reporting unit for which discrete financial information is available and results are regularly reviewed by management: wireless. The wireless reporting unit consists of all the assets and liabilities of T-Mobile US, Inc. When assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In 2022, we employed a qualitative approach to assess the wireless reporting unit. The fair value of the wireless reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. We recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. We believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value. No events or change in circumstances have occurred that indicate the fair value of the wireless reporting unit may be below its carrying amount at December 31, 2022. We test our spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. If the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. In 2022, we employed the qualitative method. We estimate fair value of spectrum licenses using the Greenfield methodology. The Greenfield methodology values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except for the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses) and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use. The value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. We base the assumptions underlying the Greenfield methodology on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. Future cash flows in the Greenfield methodology are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, EBITDA margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital. No events or change in circumstances have occurred that indicate the fair value of the Spectrum licenses may be below their carrying amount at December 31, 2022. The valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. If actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions used in our estimate of fair value, it may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. The most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures and long-term growth rate. For more information regarding our impairment assessments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 \u2013 Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair Value Measurements We carry certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs based on the observability as of the measurement date, is as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; and Level 3 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities being measured within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts receivable, Accounts receivable from affiliates and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying values of EIP receivables approximate fair value as the receivables are recorded at their present value using an imputed interest rate. With the exception of certain long-term fixed-rate debt, there were no financial instruments with a carrying value materially different from their fair value. See Note 7 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements for a comparison of the carrying values and fair values of our short-term and long-term debt. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges associated with forecasted debt issuances, changes in fair value are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until reclassified into Interest expense, net in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated in qualifying cash flow hedge relationships are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recorded at fair value as liabilities. We did not have any significant derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. Revenue Recognition We primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless communications services and selling or leasing devices and accessories to customers. Our contracts with customers may involve more than one performance obligation, which include wireless services, wireless devices or a combination thereof, and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Wireless Communications Services Revenue We generate our wireless communications services revenues from providing access to, and usage of, our wireless commun"]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["Note 19 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments We have commitments for non-dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms that generally extend through 2038. In addition, we have commitments to purchase wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business, with various terms through 2043. Our purchase commitments are approximately $4.5 billion for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2023, $4.9 billion in total for both of the 12-month periods ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, $2.8 billion in total for both of the 12-month periods ending December 31, 2026 and 2027, and $2.8 billion in total thereafter. These amounts are not reflective of our entire anticipated purchases under the related agreements but are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually obligated. Spectrum Leases We lease spectrum from various parties. These leases include service obligations to the lessors. Certain spectrum leases provide for minimum lease payments, additional charges, renewal options and escalation clauses. Leased spectrum agreements have varying expiration terms that generally extend through 2050. We expect that all renewal periods in our spectrum leases will be exercised by us. Certain spectrum leases also include purchase options and right-of-first refusal clauses in which we are provided the opportunity to exercise our purchase option if the lessor receives a purchase offer from a third party. The purchase of the leased spectrum is at our option and therefore the option price is not included in the commitments below. Our spectrum lease and service credit commitments, including renewal periods, are approximately $315 million for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2023, $587 million in total for both of the 12-month periods ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, $634 million in total for both of the 12-month periods ending December 31, 2026 and 2027, and $4.6 billion in total thereafter. On August 8, 2022, we entered into License Purchase Agreements to acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz band from Channel 51 License Co LLC and LB License Co, LLC in exchange for total cash consideration of $3.5 billion. The agreements remain subject to regulatory approval and are excluded from our reported commitments above. See Note 6 \u2013 Go odwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other In ta n gible Assets for additional details. Contingencies and Litigation Litigation and Regulatory Matters We are involved in various lawsuits and disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings (\u201cLitigation and Regulatory Matters\u201d) that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include claims of patent infringement (most of which are asserted by non-practicing entities primarily seeking monetary damages), class actions, and proceedings to enforce FCC or other government agency rules and regulations. Those Litigation and Regulatory Matters are at various stages, and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing, or other adjudication that could result in fines, penalties, or awards of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. We have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate. The accruals are reflected on our consolidated financial statements, but they are not considered to be, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where we have not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we have not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including, but not limited to, uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators, uncertain damage theories and demands, and a less than fully developed factual record. For Litigation and Regulatory Matters that may result in a contingent gain, we recognize such gains on our consolidated financial statements when the gain is realized or realizable. We recognize legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with Litigation and Regulatory Matters as they are incurred. Except as otherwise specified below, we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these Litigation and Regulatory Matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, but we note that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the specific matters identified below or other matters that we are or may become involved in could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future. On February 28, 2020, we received a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Admonishment from the FCC, which proposed a penalty against us for allegedly violating section 222 of the Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s regulations governing the privacy of customer information. In the first quarter of 2020, we recorded an accrual for an estimated payment amount. We maintained the accrual as of December 31, 2022, and that accrual was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed the contingencies and litigation matters of Sprint. Those matters include a wide variety of disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings. These matters include, among other things, certain ongoing FCC and state government agency investigations into Sprint\u2019s Lifeline program. In September 2019, Sprint notified the FCC that it had claimed monthly subsidies for serving subscribers even though these subscribers may not have met usage requirements under Sprint's usage policy for the Lifeline program, due to an inadvertent coding issue in the system used to identify qualifying subscriber usage that occurred in July 2017 while the system was being updated. Sprint has made a number of payments to reimburse the federal government and certain states for excess subsidy payments. We note that pursuant to Amendment No. 2, dated as of February 20, 2020, to the Business Combination Agreement, SoftBank agreed to indemnify us against certain specified matters and losses, including those relating to the Lifeline matters described above. Resolution of these matters could require making additional reimbursements and paying additional fines and penalties, which we do not expect to have a significant impact on our financial results. We expect that any additional liabilities related to these indemnified matters would be indemnified and reimbursed by SoftBank. On June 1, 2021, a putative shareholder class action and derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, Dinkevich v. Deutsche Telekom AG, et al. , Case No. C.A. No. 2021-0479, against DT, SoftBank and certain of our current and former officers and directors, asserting breach of fiduciary duty claims relating to the repricing amendment to the Business Combination Agreement, and to SoftBank\u2019s monetization of its T-Mobile shares. We are also named as a nominal defendant in the case. We are unable to predict the potential outcome of these claims. In October 2020, we notified Mobile Virtual Network Operators (\u201cMVNOs\u201d) using the legacy Sprint CDMA network that we planned to retire that network on December 31, 2021. In response to that notice, DISH, which had Boost Mobile customers who used the legacy Sprint CDMA network, made several efforts to prevent us from retiring the CDMA network until mid-2023, including pursuing a Petition for Modification and related proceedings pursuant to the California Public Utilities Commission\u2019s (the \u201cCPUC\u201d) April 2020 decision concerning the Merger. As of June 30, 2022, the orderly decommissioning of the legacy Sprint CDMA network had been completed, although certain of the CPUC proceedings remain in process. On August 12, 2021, we became aware of a cybersecurity issue involving unauthorized access to T-Mobile\u2019s systems (the \u201cAugust 2021 cyberattack\u201d). We immediately began an investigation and engaged cybersecurity experts to assist with the assessment of the incident and to help determine what data was impacted. Our investigation uncovered that the perpetrator had illegally gained access to certain areas of our systems on or about March 18, 2021, but only gained access to and took data of current, former, and prospective customers beginning on or about August 3, 2021. With the assistance of our outside cybersecurity experts, we located and closed the unauthorized access to our systems and identified current, former and prospective customers whose information was impacted and notified them, consistent with state and federal requirements. We also undertook a number of other measures to demonstrate our continued support and commitment to data privacy and protection. We also coordinated with law enforcement. Our forensic investigation is complete, and we believe we have a full view of the data compromised. As a result of the August 2021 cyberattack, we have become subject to numerous lawsuits, including mass arbitration claims and multiple class action lawsuits that have been filed in numerous jurisdictions seeking, among other things, unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees arising out of the August 2021 cyberattack. In December 2021, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the federal class action lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri under the caption In re: T-Mobile Customer Data Security Breach Litigation , Case No. 21-md-3019-BCW. On July 22, 2022, we entered into an agreement to settle the lawsuit. On July 26, 2022, we received preliminary approval of the proposed settlement, which remains subject to final court approval. The court conducted a final approval hearing on January 20, 2023, and we await a ruling from the court. If approved by the court, under the terms of the proposed settlement, we would pay an aggregate of $350 million to fund claims submitted by class members, the legal fees of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and the costs of administering the settlement. We would also commit to an aggregate incremental spend of $150 million for data security and related technology in 2022 and 2023. We anticipate that, upon court approval, the settlement will provide a full release of all claims arising out of the August 2021 cyberattack by class members, who do not opt out, against all defendants, including us, our subsidiaries and affiliates, and our directors and officers. The settlement contains no admission of liability, wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the defendants. We have the right to terminate the settlement agreement under certain conditions. If approved by the court, we anticipate that this settlement of the class action, along with other settlements of separate consumer claims that have been previously completed or are currently pending, will resolve substantially all of the claims brought to date by our current, former and prospective customers who were impacted by the 2021 cyberattack. In connection with the proposed class action settlement and the separate settlements, we recorded a total pre-tax charge of approximately $400 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022. The expense is included within Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $100 million in reimbursements from insurance carriers for costs incurred related to the August 2021 cyberattack, which is included as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The ultimate resolution of the class action depends on whether we will be able to obtain court approval of the proposed settlement, the number of plaintiffs who opt-out of the proposed settlement and whether the proposed settlement will be appealed. In addition, in September 2022, a purported Company shareholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Chancery Court under the caption Harper v. Sievert et al., Case No. 2022-0819-SG, against our current directors and certain of our former directors, alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty relating to the Company\u2019s cybersecurity practices. We are also named as a nominal defendant in the lawsuit. We are unable at this time to predict the potential outcome of this lawsuit or whether we may be subject to further private litigation. We have also received inquiries from various government agencies, law enforcement and other governmental authorities related to the August 2021 cyberattack which could result in substantial fines or penalties. We are responding to these inquiries and cooperating fully with these agencies and regulators. However, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any of these matters, or whether we may be subject to further regulatory inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions. In light of the inherent uncertainties involved in such matters and based on the information currently available to us, we believe it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional losses associated with these proceedings and inquiries, and we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Ongoing legal and other costs related to these proceedings and inquiries, as well as any potential future actions, may be substantial, and losses associated with any adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolutions of such proceedings and inquiries could be material to our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results. In 2022, we received $333 million in gross settlements of certain patent litigation assumed in the Merger. We recognized these settlements, net of legal fees, as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during the year ended December 31, 2022. On June 17, 2022, plaintiffs filed a putative antitrust class action complaint in the Northern District of Illinois, Dale et al. v. Deutsche Telekom AG, et al. , Case No. 1:22-cv-03189, against DT, T-Mobile, and SoftBank, alleging that the Merger violated the antitrust laws and harmed competition in the U.S. retail cell service market. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and trebled monetary damages on behalf of a purported class of AT&T and Verizon customers who plaintiffs allege paid artificially inflated prices due to the Merger. We intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit, but we are unable to predict the potential outcome. On January 5, 2023, we identified that a bad actor was obtaining data through a single API without authorization. Based on our investigation to date, the impacted API is only able to provide a limited set of customer account data, including name, billing address, email, phone number, date of birth, T-Mobile account number and information such as the number of lines on the account and plan features. The result from our investigation to date indicates that the bad actor(s) obtained data from this API for approximately 37 million current postpaid and prepaid customer accounts, though many of these accounts did not include the full data set. We believe that the bad actor first retrieved data through the impacted API starting on or around November 25, 2022. We continue to investigate the incident and have notified individuals whose information was impacted consistent with state and federal requirements. In connection with the January 2023 cyberattack, we have received notices of consumer class actions and regulatory inquires, to which we will respond to in due course and may incur significant expenses. However, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any of these potential matters, or whether we may be subject to additional legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions. In addition, we are unable to predict the full impact of this incident on customer behavior in the future, including whether a change in our customers\u2019 behavior could negatively impact our results of operations on an ongoing basis, although we presently do not expect that it will have a material effect on our operations."]}, "Debt": {"Debt": ["Note 8 \u2013 Debt Debt was as follows: (in millions) December 31, December 31, 4.000% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2022 $ \u2014 $ 1,000 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022 \u2014 500 5.375% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2022 \u2014 1,250 6.000% Senior Notes due 2022 \u2014 2,280 7.875% Senior Notes due 2023 4,250 4,250 7.125% Senior Notes due 2024 2,500 2,500 3.500% Senior Notes due 2025 3,000 3,000 4.738% Series 2018-1 A-1 Notes due 2025 1,181 1,706 7.625% Senior Notes due 2025 1,500 1,500 1.500% Senior Notes due 2026 1,000 1,000 2.250% Senior Notes due 2026 1,800 1,800 2.625% Senior Notes due 2026 1,200 1,200 7.625% Senior Notes due 2026 1,500 1,500 3.750% Senior Notes due 2027 4,000 4,000 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 500 500 2.050% Senior Notes due 2028 1,750 1,750 4.750% Senior Notes due 2028 1,500 1,500 4.750% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2028 1,500 1,500 4.910% Class A Senior ABS Notes due 2028 750 \u2014 5.152% Series 2018-1 A-2 Notes due 2028 1,838 1,838 6.875% Senior Notes due 2028 2,475 2,475 2.400% Senior Notes due 2029 500 500 2.625% Senior Notes due 2029 1,000 1,000 3.375% Senior Notes due 2029 2,350 2,350 3.875% Senior Notes due 2030 7,000 7,000 2.250% Senior Notes due 2031 1,000 1,000 2.550% Senior Notes due 2031 2,500 2,500 2.875% Senior Notes due 2031 1,000 1,000 3.500% Senior Notes due 2031 2,450 2,450 2.700% Senior Notes due 2032 1,000 1,000 8.750% Senior Notes due 2032 2,000 2,000 5.200% Senior Notes due 2033 1,250 \u2014 4.375% Senior Notes due 2040 2,000 2,000 3.000% Senior Notes due 2041 2,500 2,500 4.500% Senior Notes due 2050 3,000 3,000 3.300% Senior Notes due 2051 3,000 3,000 3.400% Senior Notes due 2052 2,800 2,800 5.650% Senior Notes due 2053 1,000 \u2014 3.600% Senior Notes due 2060 1,700 1,700 5.800% Senior Notes due 2062 750 \u2014 Other debt 20 47 Unamortized premium on debt to third parties 1,335 1,740 Unamortized discount on debt to affiliates \u2014 (5) Unamortized discount on debt to third parties (199) (200) Debt issuance costs and consent fees (240) (238) Total debt 71,960 74,193 Less: Current portion of Senior Notes to affiliates \u2014 2,245 Less: Current portion of Senior Notes and other debt to third parties 5,164 3,378 Total long-term debt $ 66,796 $ 68,570 Classified on the consolidated balance sheets as: Long-term debt $ 65,301 $ 67,076 Long-term debt to affiliates 1,495 1,494 Total long-term debt $ 66,796 $ 68,570 Our effective interest rate, excluding the impact of derivatives and capitalized interest, was approximately 3.9% and 4.1% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on weighted-average debt outstanding of $72.5 billion and $74.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The weighted-average debt outstanding was calculated by applying an average of the monthly ending balances of total short-term and long-term debt and short-term and long-term debt to affiliates, net of unamortized premiums, discounts, debt issuance costs and consent fees. Senior Secured Notes Following the achievement of an investment grade issuer rating from each of the three main credit rating agencies, on August 22, 2022, we entered into an amendment (\u201cCredit Agreement Amendment\u201d) to our Credit Agreement, dated April 1, 2020 to release the liens securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement. Upon effectiveness of the Credit Agreement Amendment, the liens securing the Senior Secured Notes were also automatically released, and our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes (thereafter, together with our other senior unsecured notes, \u201cSenior Notes\u201d), which for the avoidance of doubt exclude the Spectrum-Backed Notes, are no longer secured. Senior Notes The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries. They are redeemable at our discretion, in whole or in part, at any time. The redemption price is calculated by reference to date on which such notes are redeemed and generally includes a premium that steps down gradually as the Senior Notes approach their par call date, on or after which they are redeemable at par. The amount of time by which the par call date precedes the maturity date of the respective series of Senior Notes varies from one Issuances and Borrowings During the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued the following Senior Notes and ABS Notes: (in millions) Principal Issuances Premiums/Discounts and Issuance Costs Net Proceeds from Issuance of Long-Term Debt Issue Date 5.200% Senior Notes due 2033 $ 1,250 $ (8) $ 1,242 September 15, 2022 5.650% Senior Notes due 2053 1,000 (11) 989 September 15, 2022 5.800% Senior Notes due 2062 750 (12) 738 September 15, 2022 Total of Senior Notes issued $ 3,000 $ (31) $ 2,969 4.910% Class A Senior ABS Notes due 2028 750 (4) 746 October 12, 2022 Total of ABS Notes issued $ 750 $ (4) $ 746 On September 15, 2022, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued an aggregate of $3.0 billion of Senior Notes bearing interest from 5.200% to 5.800% and maturing in 2033 to 2062, and used the net proceeds of $3.0 billion for general corporate purposes, including among other things, share repurchases and refinancing of existing indebtedness on an ongoing basis. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, on February 9, 2023, we issued $1.0 billion of 4.950% Senior Notes due 2028, $1.3 billion of 5.050% Senior Notes due 2033 and $750 million of 5.650% Senior Notes due 2053. We intend to use the net proceeds of $3.0 billion for general corporate purposes, which may include among other things, share repurchases and refinancing of existing indebtedness on an ongoing basis. Credit Facilities On October 17, 2022, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cOctober 2022 Credit Agreement\u201d) with certain financial institutions named therein. The October 2022 Credit Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the Credit Agreement originally dated April 1, 2020, and provides for a $7.5 billion revolving credit facility, including a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $1.5 billion, and a swingline loan sub-facility of up to $500 million. Commitments under the October 2022 Credit Agreement will mature on October 17, 2027, except as otherwise extended or replaced. Borrowings under the October 2022 Credit Agreement will bear interest based upon the applicable benchmark rate, depending on the type of loan and, in some cases, at our election, plus a margin that is determined by reference to the credit rating of T-Mobile USA\u2019s senior unsecured long-term debt. The October 2022 Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including a financial maintenance covenant of 4.5x with respect to T-Mobile USA, Inc.\u2019s Leverage Ratio (as defined therein) commencing with the period ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have an outstanding balance under this facility. Note Redemptions and Repayments During the year ended December 31, 2022, we made the following note redemptions and repayments: (in millions) Principal Amount Redemption or Repayment Date Redemption Price 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022 $ 500 March 16, 2022 100.000 % 4.000% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2022 1,000 March 16, 2022 100.000 % 5.375% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2022 1,250 April 15, 2022 N/A 6.000% Senior Notes due 2022 2,280 November 15, 2022 N/A Total Redemptions $ 5,030 4.738% Secured Series 2018-1 A-1 Notes due 2025 $ 525 Various N/A Other debt 1 Various N/A Total Repayments $ 526 Our losses on extinguishment of debt were $184 million and $371 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in Other expense, net on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. There was no loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2022. Asset-backed Notes On October 12, 2022, we issued $750 million of 4.910% Class A Senior ABS Notes to third-party investors in a private placement transaction. Our ABS Notes are secured by $1.0 billion of gross EIP receivables and future collections on such receivables. In connection with issuing the ABS Notes, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity (the \u201cABS BRE\u201d), and a trust (the \u201cABS Trust\u201d and together with the ABS BRE, the \u201cABS Entities\u201d), in which the ABS BRE holds a residual interest. The ABS BRE\u2019s residual interest in the ABS Trust represents the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on the ABS Notes and other related payments and expenses. Under the terms of the ABS Notes, our wholly owned subsidiary, T-Mobile Financial LLC (\u201cFinCo\u201d), and certain of our other wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cOriginators\u201d) transfer EIP receivables to the ABS BRE, which in turn transfers such receivables to the ABS Trust, which issued the ABS Notes. The Class A senior ABS Notes have an expected weighted average life of approximately 2.5 years. Under the terms of the transaction, there is a two-year revolving period during which we may transfer additional receivables to the ABS Entities as collections on the receivables are received. The EIP receivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of the ABS Notes and expenses related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other obligations arising from our ABS Notes transactions, and will not be available to pay our other obligations until the associated ABS Notes and related obligations are satisfied. The third-party investors in the Class A senior ABS Notes have legal recourse only to the assets of the ABS Trust securing the ABS Notes and do not have any recourse to T-Mobile with respect to the payment of principal and interest. The receivables transferred to the ABS Trust will only be available for payment of the ABS Notes and other obligations arising from the transaction and will not be available to pay any obligations or claims of T-Mobile\u2019s creditors. Under a parent support agreement, T-Mobile has agreed to guarantee the performance of the obligations of FinCo, which will continue to service the receivables, and the other T-Mobile entities participating in the transaction. However, T-Mobile does not guarantee any principal or interest on the ABS Notes or any payments on the underlying EIP receivables. The ABS Notes are redeemable, in whole but not in part, on or after the payment date in November 2023. If redeemed on or after the payment date in November 2024, or if the aggregate principal balance of the transferred EIP receivables is equal to or less than 10% of the aggregate principal balance of the EIP receivables transferred upon issuance of the ABS Notes, we can redeem the ABS Notes without incurring a Make-Whole Payment; otherwise, a Make-Whole Payment applies. Cash collections on the EIP receivables are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net proceeds of $746 million from our ABS Notes are reflected in Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the year ended December 31, 2022. The ABS Notes issued and the assets securing this debt are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The expected maturities of our ABS Notes are as follows: Expected Maturities (in millions) 2024 2025 4.910% Class A Senior ABS Notes due 2028 $ 198 $ 552 Variable Interest Entities The ABS Entities meet the definition of a VIE for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities of the ABS Entities that most significantly impact their performance. Those activities include selecting which receivables are transferred into the ABS Entities, servicing such receivables, and funding of the ABS Entities. Additionally, our equity interest and residual interest in the ABS BRE and the ABS Trust, respectively, obligate us to absorb losses and gives us the right to receive benefits from the ABS Entities that could potentially be significant to the ABS Entities. Accordingly, we include the balances and results of operations of the ABS Entities in our consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets and liabilities included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to the ABS Entities: December 31, (in millions) Assets Equipment installment plan receivables, net $ 652 Equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net 281 Other current assets 73 Liabilities Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 1 Long-term debt 746 See Note 3 \u2013 Receivable and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information on the EIP receivables used to secure the ABS Notes. Spectrum Financing On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed Sprint\u2019s spectrum-backed notes, which are collateralized by the acquired, directly held and third-party leased Spectrum licenses (collectively, the \u201cSpectrum Portfolio\u201d) transferred to wholly owned bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities (collectively, the \u201cSpectrum Financing SPEs\u201d). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total outstanding obligations under these Notes was $3.0 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. In October 2016, certain subsidiaries of Sprint Communications, Inc. transferred the Spectrum Portfolio to the Spectrum Financing SPEs, which was used as collateral to raise an initial $3.5 billion in senior secured notes (the \u201c2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes\u201d) bearing interest at 3.360% per annum under a $7.0 billion securitization program. The 2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes were repayable over a five-year term, with interest-only payments over the first four quarters and amortizing quarterly principal payments thereafter commencing December 2017 through September 2021. We fully repaid the 2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes in 2021. In March 2018, Sprint issued approximately $3.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (the \u201c2018 Spectrum-Backed Notes\u201d and together with the 2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes, the \u201cSpectrum-Backed Notes\u201d) under the existing $7.0 billion securitization program, consisting of two series of senior secured notes. The first series of notes totaled $2.1 billion in aggregate principal amount, bears interest at 4.738% per annum, and has quarterly interest-only payments until June 2021, with additional quarterly principal payments commencing in June 2021 through March 2025. As of December 31, 2022, $525 million of the aggregate principal amount was classified as Short-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The second series of notes totaled approximately $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount, bears interest at 5.152% per annum, and has quarterly interest-only payments until June 2023, with additional quarterly principal payments commencing in June 2023 through March 2028. As of December 31, 2022, $276 million of the aggregate principal amount was classified as Short-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Spectrum Portfolio, which also serves as collateral for the Spectrum-Backed Notes, remains substantially identical to the original portfolio from October 2016. Simultaneously with the October 2016 offering, Sprint Communications, Inc. entered into a long-term lease with the Spectrum Financing SPEs for the ongoing use of the Spectrum Portfolio. Sprint Communications, Inc. is required to make monthly lease payments to the Spectrum Financing SPEs in an aggregate amount that is market-based relative to the spectrum usage rights as of the closing date and equal to $165 million per month. The lease payments, which are guaranteed by T-Mobile subsidiaries subsequent to the Merger, are sufficient to service all outstanding series of the 2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes and the lease also constitutes collateral for the senior secured notes. Because the Spectrum Financing SPEs are wholly owned T-Mobile subsidiaries subsequent to the Merger, these entities are consolidated and all intercompany activity has been eliminated. Each Spectrum Financing SPE is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled, prior to and upon the liquidation of the respective Spectrum Financing SPE, to be satisfied out of the Spectrum Financing SPE\u2019s assets prior to any assets of such Spectrum Financing SPE becoming available to T-Mobile. Accordingly, the assets of each Spectrum Financing SPE are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations owed to other creditors of T-Mobile until the obligations of such Spectrum Financing SPE under the Spectrum-Backed Notes are paid in full. Certain provisions of the Spectrum Financing facility require us to maintain specified cash collateral balances. Amounts associated with these balances are considered to be restricted cash. Restricted Cash Certain provisions of our debt agreements require us to maintain specified cash collateral balances. Amounts associated with these balances are considered to be restricted cash. Standby Letters of Credit For the purposes of securing our obligations to provide device insurance services and for the purposes of securing our general purpose obligations, we maintain an agreement for standby letters of credit with certain financial institutions. We assumed certain of Sprint\u2019s standby letters of credit in the Merger. Our outstanding standby letters of credit were $352 million and $441 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively."]}, "external_audit": "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of T-Mobile US, Inc. \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of T-Mobile US, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nRevenues \u2013 Refer to Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company generates revenues from providing wireless communications services and selling devices and accessories to customers. The processing and recording of wireless communications services revenues related to monthly wireless services billings is highly automated and is based on contractual terms with customers. Equipment revenues related to device and accessory sales are typically recognized at a point in time when control of the device or accessory is transferred to the customer or dealer. The Company\u2019s wireless service and equipment revenues consist of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions accumulated from multiple systems and databases. \n\nGiven the large volume of low-dollar wireless communications services and equipment revenue transactions which are initiated, accumulated, and recorded in multiple systems and databases, auditing revenues was complex and challenging due to the extent of audit effort required and the need for professionals with expertise in information technology (IT) to identify, evaluate, and test the Company\u2019s systems, databases, automated controls, and system interface controls. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the Company\u2019s revenue transactions included the following, among others: \n\n\u2022 With the assistance of our IT specialists, we: \n\n\u2022 Identified the relevant systems and databases used to process revenue transactions and tested the relevant IT controls over each of those systems and databases. \n\n\u2022 Performed testing of automated business controls and system interface controls within wireless communications services and equipment revenues. \n\n\u2022 We tested internal controls in the revenue accounting processes, including those in place to (a) establish revenue recognition accounting policies for promotional offers, (b) record revenue and the related promotional offers in accordance with the established accounting policies and (c) reconcile the various systems to the Company\u2019s general ledger. \n\n\u2022 We created data visualizations to evaluate recorded revenue and trends in the related subscriber data. \n\n\u2022 For a selection of equipment revenue transactions, we compared the amounts recognized to contractual agreements or other source documents and tested the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenue. \n\n\u2022 We developed an expectation of postpaid and prepaid service revenue amounts using historical service revenue and subscriber information and compared it to the recorded amount. \n\n\u2022 We tested the accuracy and completeness of the subscriber information used in our audit procedures by selecting a sample of the subscriber information and for those selections agreeing the selected subscriber information to supporting documentation. \n\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nFebruary 14, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2022. \n\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of T-Mobile US, Inc. \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, of stockholders\u2019 equity and of cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nFebruary 11, 2022 \n\nWe served as the Company\u2019s auditor from 2001 to 2022. \n\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nT-Mobile US, Inc. \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n\n (in millions, except share and per share amounts) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,507 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1283699/000128369923000016/tmus-20221231.htm"}, "2021": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business T-Mobile US, Inc. (\u201cT-Mobile,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a leading provider of mobile communications services, including voice, messaging and data, under its flagship brands, T-Mobile and Metro\u2122 by T-Mobile (\"Metro by T-Mobile\"), in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Substantially all of our revenues were earned in, and substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in, the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We provide mobile communications services primarily using our 4G Long Term Evolution (\u201cLTE\u201d) network and our 5G technology network. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including handsets, tablets and other mobile communication devices, and accessories for sale, as well as financing through equipment installment plans (\u201cEIP\u201d) and leasing through JUMP! On Demand\u2122. Additionally, we provide reinsurance for device insurance policies and extended warranty contracts offered to our mobile communications customers. Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the balances and results of operations of T-Mobile and our consolidated subsidiaries. We consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, as well as variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and VIEs, which cannot be deconsolidated, such as those related to Tower obligations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. We operate as a single operating segment. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions which affect our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including, but not limited to, the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed through the Merger with Sprint and through our acquisitions of affiliates and the potential impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic (the \u201cPandemic\u201d). These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. Business Combinations Assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset or liability. See Note 2 \u2013 Business Combinatio ns for further discussion of the Merger between T-Mobile and Sprint and the acquisition of the wireless telecommunications assets (the \u201cWireless Assets\u201d) of Shenandoah Personal Communications Company LLC (\u201cShentel\u201d) used to provide Sprint PCS\u2019s wireless mobility communications network products in certain parts of Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia Kentucky, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Receivables and Related Allowance for Credit Losses Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable balances are predominantly composed of amounts currently due from customers (e.g., for wireless services and monthly device lease payments), device insurance administrators, wholesale partners, other carriers and third-party retail channels. Accounts receivable are presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amortized cost basis (i.e., the receivables\u2019 unpaid principal balance (\u201cUPB\u201d) as adjusted for any write-offs), net of the allowance for credit losses. We have an arrangement to sell certain of our customer service accounts receivable on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. Equipment Installment Plan Receivables We offer certain customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments, generally over a period of 24 months using an EIP. EIP receivables are presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amortized cost basis (i.e., the receivables\u2019 UPB as adjusted for any write-offs and unamortized discounts), net of the allowance for credit losses. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest if the term exceeds 12 months as there is no stated rate of interest on the receivables. The receivables are recorded at their present value, which is determined by discounting expected future cash payments at the imputed interest rate. This adjustment results in a discount or reduction in transaction price which is allocated to the performance obligations and reduces Service revenues and Equipment revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The imputed discount rate reflects a current market interest rate and is predominately comprised of the estimated credit risk underlying the EIP receivable, reflecting the estimated credit worthiness of the customer. The imputed discount on receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as Other revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The current portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables, net and the long-term portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have an arrangement to sell certain EIP receivables on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. Allowance for Credit Losses We maintain an allowance for credit losses by applying an expected credit loss model. Each period, management assesses the appropriateness of the level of allowance for credit losses by considering credit risk inherent within each portfolio segment as of period end. Each portfolio segment is composed of pools of receivables that are evaluated collectively based on similar risk characteristics. Our allowance levels consider estimated credit risk over the contractual life of the receivables and are influenced by receivable volumes, receivable delinquency status, historical loss experience and other conditions that affect loss expectations, such as changes in credit and collections policies and forecasts of macro-economic conditions. While we attribute portions of the allowance to our respective accounts receivable and EIP portfolio segments, the entire allowance is available to credit losses related to the total receivable portfolio. We consider a receivable past due and delinquent when a customer has not paid us by the contractually specified payment due date. Account balances are written off against the allowance for credit losses if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible (customer default), based on factors such as customer credit ratings as well as the length of time the amounts are past due. If there is a deterioration of our customers\u2019 financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we will adjust our allowance for credit losses accordingly, which may materially affect our financial results in the period the adjustments are made. Inventories Inventories consist primarily of wireless devices and accessories, which are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using standard cost, which approximates average cost. Shipping and handling costs paid to wireless device and accessories vendors as well as costs to refurbish used devices are included in the standard cost of inventory. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of disposal and transportation. We record inventory write-downs to net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving items based on inventory turnover trends and historical experience. Deferred Purchase Price Assets In connection with the sales of certain service and EIP accounts receivable pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable Level 3 inputs, including estimated customer default rates and credit worthiness. See Note 4 \u2013 Sales of Certain Receivables for further information. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets include assets that do not have indefinite lives, such as property and equipment and certain intangible assets. Substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the U.S., including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indicators of impairment are present, we test recoverability. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the asset or asset group\u2019s carrying amount, then an impairment loss is recorded, measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of buildings and equipment, wireless communications systems, leasehold improvements, capitalized software, leased wireless devices and construction in progress. Buildings and equipment include certain network server equipment. Wireless communications systems include assets to operate our wireless network and information technology data centers, including tower assets and leasehold improvements and assets related to the liability for the retirement of long-lived assets. Leasehold improvements include asset improvements other than those related to the wireless network. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments, if any, in Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit using the straight-line method. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book value is depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease term. Costs of major replacements and improvements are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures which do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Construction costs, labor and overhead incurred in the expansion or enhancement of our wireless network are capitalized. Capitalization commences with pre-construction period administrative and technical activities, which include obtaining zoning approvals and building permits, and ceases at the point at which the asset is ready for its intended use. We capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of certain property and equipment. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated over the useful life of the related assets. We record an asset retirement obligation for the estimated fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, we recognize changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. Our obligations relate primarily to certain legal obligations to remediate leased property on which our network infrastructure and administrative assets are located. We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or acquiring internal use software. Capitalization of software costs commences once the final selection of the specific software solution has been made and management authorizes and commits to funding the software project and ceases once the project is ready for its intended use. Capitalized software costs are included in Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. Device Leases Through the Merger, we acquired device lease contracts in which Sprint is the lessor (the \u201cSprint Flex Lease Program\u201d), substantially all of which are classified as operating leases, as well as the associated fixed assets (i.e., the leased devices). These leased devices were recorded as fixed assets at their acquisition date fair value and presented within Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Beginning in 2021, we discontinued offering the Sprint Flex lease program and are shifting customer device financing to EIP plans. Our leasing programs (\u201cLeasing Programs\u201d), which include JUMP! On Demand and the Sprint Flex Lease Program, allow customers to lease a device (handset or tablet) generally over a period of 18 months and upgrade the device with a new device when eligibility requirements are met. We depreciate leased devices to their estimated residual value, on a group basis, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the device. The estimated useful life reflects the period for which we estimate the group of leased devices will provide utility to us, which may be longer than the initial lease term based on customer options in the Sprint Flex Lease program to renew the lease on a month-to-month basis after the initial lease term concludes. In determining the estimated useful life, we consider the lease term (e.g., 18 months and month-to-month renewal options for the Sprint Flex Lease Program), trade-in activity and write-offs for lost and stolen devices. Lost and stolen devices are incorporated into the estimates of depreciation expense and recognized as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation when the loss event occurs. Our policy of using the group method of depreciation has been applied to acquired leased devices as well as leases originated subsequent to the Merger. Acquired leased devices are grouped based on the age of the device. Revenues associated with the leased devices, net of lease incentives, are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For arrangements in which we are the lessor of devices, we separate lease and non-lease components. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers in the JUMP! On Demand lease program must return or purchase their device, and customers in the Sprint Flex Lease Program have the option to return or purchase their device or to renew their lease on a month-to-month basis. The purchase price of the device is established at lease commencement and is based on the type of device leased and any down payment made. The Leasing Programs do not contain any residual value guarantees or variable lease payments, and there are no restrictions or covenants imposed by these leases. Returned devices, including those received upon device upgrade, are transferred from Property and equipment, net to Inventory on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with any write-down recognized as Cost of equipment sales on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets that do not have indefinite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Customer lists and the Sprint trade name are amortized using the sum-of-the-years digits method over the period in which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. Reacquired rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the Management Agreement (as defined in Note 2), which represents the period of expected economic benefit. The remaining finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination and is assigned to our one reporting unit: wireless. Spectrum Licenses Spectrum licenses are carried at costs incurred to acquire the spectrum licenses and the costs to prepare the spectrum licenses for their intended use, such as costs to clear acquired spectrum licenses. The Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) issues spectrum licenses which provide us with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum within specific geographic service areas to provide wireless communications services. Spectrum licenses are issued for a fixed period of time, typically up to 15 years; however, the FCC has granted license renewals routinely and at a nominal cost. The spectrum licenses acquired expire at various dates and we believe we will be able to meet all requirements necessary to secure renewal of our spectrum licenses at a nominal cost. Moreover, we determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our spectrum licenses. Therefore, we determined the spectrum licenses should be treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets. At times, we enter into agreements to sell or exchange spectrum licenses. Upon entering into the arrangement, if the transaction has been deemed to have commercial substance, spectrum licenses are reviewed for impairment. The licenses are transferred at their carrying value, as adjusted for any impairment recognized, to assets held for sale, which is included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets until approval and completion of the exchange or sale. Upon closing of the transaction, spectrum licenses acquired as part of an exchange of nonmonetary assets are recorded at fair value and the difference between the fair value of the spectrum licenses obtained, carrying value of the spectrum licenses transferred and cash paid, if any, is recognized as a gain or loss on disposal of spectrum licenses included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Our fair value estimates of spectrum licenses are based on information for which there is little or no observable market data. If the transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value is not measurable, the acquired spectrum licenses are recorded at our carrying value of the spectrum assets transferred or exchanged. Spectrum Leases Through the Merger, we acquired lease agreements (the \u201cAgreements\u201d) with various educational and non-profit institutions that provide us with the right to use FCC spectrum licenses (Educational Broadband Services or \u201cEBS spectrum\u201d) in the 2.5 GHz band. In addition to the Agreements with educational institutions and private owners who hold the licenses, we also acquired direct ownership of spectrum licenses previously acquired by Sprint through government auctions or other acquisitions. The Agreements with educational and certain non-profit institutions are typically for five Leased FCC spectrum licenses are recorded as executory contracts whereby, as a result of business combination accounting, an intangible asset or liability is recorded reflecting the extent to which contractual terms are favorable or unfavorable to current market rates. These intangible assets or liabilities are amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the lease agreements. Contractual lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the arrangement, including renewals, and are presented in Costs of services on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The Agreements enhance the overall value of our spectrum licenses as the collective value is higher than the value of individual bands of spectrum within a specific geography. This value is derived from the ability to provide wireless service to customers across large geographic areas and maintain the same or similar wireless connectivity quality. This enhanced value from combining owned and leased spectrum licenses is referred to as an aggregation premium. The aggregation premium is a component of the overall fair value of our owned FCC spectrum licenses, which are recorded as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment We assess the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum license portfolio, for potential impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired. When assessing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the wireless reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill recognized in the reporting unit. We test our spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. If the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. We estimate fair value using the Greenfield methodology, which is an income approach based on discounted cash flows associated with the intangible asset, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Restricted Cash Certain provisions of our debt agreements require us to maintain specified cash collateral balances. Amounts associated with these balances are considered to be restricted cash and are included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair Value Measurements We carry certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs based on the observability as of the measurement date, is as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; and Level 3 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities being measured within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts receivable, Accounts receivable from affiliates and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying values of EIP receivables approximate fair value as the receivables are recorded at their present value using an imputed interest rate. With the exception of certain long-term fixed-rate debt, there were no financial instruments with a carrying value materially different from their fair value. See Note 7 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements for a comparison of the carrying values and fair values of our short-term and long-term debt. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges associated with forecasted debt issuances, changes in fair value are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until reclassified into Interest expense in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated in qualifying cash flow hedge relationships are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recorded at fair value as liabilities. Revenue Recognition We primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless services and selling or leasing devices and accessories to customers. Our contracts with customers may involve multiple performance obligations, which include wireless services, wireless devices or a combination thereof, and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Significant Judgments The most significant judgments affecting the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with our customers include the following items: \u2022 Promotional EIP bill credits offered to a customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether a substantive penalty is deemed to exist. \u2022 The identification of distinct performance obligations within our service plans may require significant judgment. \u2022 Revenue is recorded net of costs paid to another party for performance obligations where we arrange for the other party to transfer goods or services to the customer (i.e., when we are acting as an agent). For example, performance obligations relating to services provided by third-party content providers where we neither control a right to the content provider\u2019s service nor control the underlying service itself are presented net because we are acting as an agent. The determination of whether we control the underlying service or right to the service prior to our transfer to the customer requires, at times, significant judgment. \u2022 Our products are generally sold with a right of return, which is accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Device return levels are estimated based on the expected value method as there are a large number of contracts with similar characteristics and the outcome of each contract is independent of the others. Historical return rate experience is a significant input to our expected value methodology. \u2022 Sales of equipment to indirect dealers who have been identified as our customer (referred to as the sell-in model) often include credits subsequently paid to the dealer as a reimbursement for any discount promotions offered to the end consumer. These credits (payments to a customer, the dealer) are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize from the sales of equipment to indirect dealers and are estimated based on historical experience and other factors, such as expected promotional activity. \u2022 The determination of the standalone selling price for contracts that involve more than one performance obligation may require significant judgment, such as when the selling price of a good or service is not readily observable. Wireless Services Revenue We generate our wireless services revenues from providing access to, and usage of, our wireless communications network. Service revenues also include revenues earned for providing premium services to customers, such as device insurance services. Service contracts are billed monthly either in advance or arrears, or are prepaid. Generally, service revenue is recognized as we satisfy our performance obligation to transfer service to our customers. We typically satisfy our stand-ready performance obligations, including unlimited wireless services, evenly over the contract term. For usage-based and prepaid wireless services, we satisfy our performance obligations when services are rendered. Consideration payable to a customer is treated as a reduction of the total transaction price, unless the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service, such as certain commissions paid to dealers, in which case the payment is treated as a purchase of that distinct good or service. Federal Universal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d) and other fees are assessed by various governmental authorities in connection with the services we provide to our customers and are included in Cost of services. When we separately bill and collect these regulatory fees from customers, they are recorded gross in Total service revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded approximately $216 million, $267 million and $93 million, respectively, of USF fees on a gross basis. We have made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by us from a customer (e.g., sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes). Wireline Revenue Performance obligations related to our Wireline customers include the provision of domestic and international data communications services, generally to complement wireless services. Wireline revenues are included in Other service revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Equipment Revenues We generate equipment revenues from the sale or lease of mobile communication devices and accessories. For performance obligations related to equipment contracts, we typically transfer control at a point in time when the device or accessory is delivered to, and accepted by, the customer or dealer. We have elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related good transfers as fulfillment activities instead of assessing such activities as performance obligations. We estimate variable consideration (e.g., device returns or certain payments to indirect dealers) primarily based on historical experience. Equipment sales not probable of collection are generally recorded as payments are received. Our assessment of collectibility considers contract terms such as down payments that reduce our exposure to credit risk. We offer certain customers the option to pay for devices and accessories in installments using an EIP. Generally, we recognize as a reduction of the total transaction price the effects of a financing component in contracts where customers purchase their"]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["Note 17 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments We have commitments for non-dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms that generally extend through 2031. In addition, we have commitments to purchase wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business, with various terms through 2043. Our purchase commitments are approximately $4.7 billion for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2022, $5.6 billion in total for the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2023 and 2024, $2.1 billion in total for the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2025 and 2026, and $1.6 billion in total thereafter. These amounts are not reflective of our entire anticipated purchases under the related agreements but are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually obligated. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, on January 3, 2022, we entered into the Crown Agreement with CCI that will enable us to lease towers from CCI through December 2033, followed by optional renewals. The Crown Agreement amends the pricing for our non-dedicated transportation lines, which includes lit fiber backhaul and small cell circuits. We have committed to an annual volume commitment to execute and deliver 35,000 small cell contracts, including upgrades to existing locations, over the next five years. The minimum commitment for small cells is $1.8 billion through 2039. Spectrum Leases In connection with the Merger, we assumed certain spectrum lease contracts from Sprint that include service obligations to the lessors. Certain of the spectrum leases provide for minimum lease payments, additional charges, renewal options and escalation clauses. Leased spectrum agreements have varying expiration terms that generally extend through 2050. We expect that all renewal periods in our spectrum leases will be exercised by us. Our spectrum lease and service credit commitments, including renewal periods, are approximately $350 million for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2022, $611 million in total for the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2023 and 2024, $591 million in total for the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2025 and 2026 and $4.7 billion in total thereafter. We accrue a monthly obligation for the services and equipment based on the total estimated available service credits divided by the term of the lease. The obligation is reduced by services provided and as actual invoices are presented and paid to the lessors. The maximum remaining service commitment on December 31, 2021 was $85 million and is expected to be incurred over the term of the related lease agreements, which generally range from 15 to 30 years. Merger Commitments In connection with the regulatory proceedings and approvals of the Transactions, we have commitments and other obligations to various state and federal agencies and certain nongovernmental organizations, including pursuant to the Consent Decree agreed to by us, DT, Sprint, SoftBank and DISH Network Corporation (\u201cDISH\u201d) and entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and the FCC\u2019s memorandum opinion and order approving our applications for approval of the Merger. These commitments and obligations include, among other things, extensive 5G network build-out commitments, obligations to deliver high-speed wireless services to the vast majority of Americans, including Americans residing in rural areas, and the marketing of an in-home broadband product where spectrum capacity is available. Other commitments relate to national security, pricing, service, employment and support of diversity initiatives. Many of the commitments specify time frames for compliance. Failure to fulfill our obligations and commitments in a timely manner could result in substantial fines, penalties, or other legal and administrative actions. We expect that our monetary commitments associated with these matters are approximately $11 million for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2022, $12 million in total for the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2023 and 2024. We do not expect any amounts after December 31, 2024. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated costs to achieve specified network coverage and performance requirements, employment targets or commitments to provide access to affordable rate plans, but represent only those amounts for which we are required to make a specified payment in connection with our commitments or settlements. Contingencies and Litigation Litigation and Regulatory Matters We are involved in various lawsuits and disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings (\u201cLitigation and Regulatory Matters\u201d) that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include claims of patent infringement (most of which are asserted by non-practicing entities primarily seeking monetary damages), class actions, and proceedings to enforce FCC rules and regulations. Those Litigation and Regulatory Matters are at various stages, and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing, or other adjudication that could result in fines, penalties, or awards of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. We have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate. The accruals are reflected in the consolidated financial statements but they are not considered to be, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where we have not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we have not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including, but not limited to, uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators, uncertain damage theories and demands, and a less than fully developed factual record. For Litigation and Regulatory Matters that may result in a contingent gain, we recognize such gains in the consolidated financial statements when the gain is realized or realizable. We recognize legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with Litigation and Regulatory Matters as they are incurred. Except as otherwise specified below, we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these Litigation and Regulatory Matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, but we note that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the specific matters identified below could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future. On February 28, 2020, we received a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Admonishment from the FCC, which proposed a penalty against us for allegedly violating section 222 of the Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s regulations governing the privacy of customer information. In the first quarter of 2020, we recorded an accrual for an estimated payment amount. We maintained the accrual as of December 31, 2021, and that accrual was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed the contingencies and litigation matters of Sprint. Those matters include a wide variety of disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings. These matters include, among other things, certain ongoing FCC and state government agency investigations into Sprint\u2019s Lifeline program. In September 2019, Sprint notified the FCC that it had claimed monthly subsidies for serving subscribers even though these subscribers may not have met usage requirements under Sprint's usage policy for the Lifeline program, due to an inadvertent coding issue in the system used to identify qualifying subscriber usage that occurred in July 2017 while the system was being updated. Sprint has made a number of payments to reimburse the federal government and certain states for excess subsidy payments. We note that pursuant to Amendment No. 2 to the Business Combination Agreement, SoftBank agreed to indemnify us against certain specified matters and losses, including those relating to the Lifeline matters described above. Resolution of these matters could require making additional reimbursements and paying additional fines and penalties, which we do not expect to have a significant impact on our financial results. We expect that any additional liabilities related to these indemnified matters would be indemnified and reimbursed by SoftBank. See Note 2 \u2013 Business Combinations for further information. On June 1, 2021, a putative shareholder class action and derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, Dinkevich v. Deutsche Telekom AG, et al. , Case No. C.A. No. 2021-0479, against DT, SoftBank and certain of our current and former officers and directors, asserting breach of fiduciary duty claims relating to the repricing amendment to the Business Combination Agreement, and to SoftBank\u2019s monetization of its T-Mobile shares. We are also named as a nominal defendant in the case. We are unable to predict the potential outcome of these claims. We intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit. In October 2020, we notified MVNOs using the legacy Sprint CDMA network that we planned to sunset that network on December 31, 2021. In response to that notice, DISH, which has Boost Mobile customers who use the legacy Sprint CDMA network, has made several efforts to prevent us from sunsetting the CDMA network until mid-2023, including by urging the U.S. Department of Justice to move for a finding of contempt under the April 1, 2020 Final Judgment entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and by pursuing a Petition for Modification and related proceedings pursuant to the California Public Utilities Commission (the \u201cCPUC\u201d)\u2019s April 2020 decision concerning the T-Mobile-Sprint merger. We disagree with the merits of DISH\u2019s positions and have opposed them. On October 22, 2021, we announced that we would delay the sunset of the legacy Sprint CDMA network for three months, until March 31, 2022, to, among other things, help ensure that DISH and other MVNOs fulfill their contractual responsibilities and transition customers off the legacy Sprint CDMA network before the sunset. On February 2, 2022, the CPUC Administrative Law Judge presiding over DISH's Petition for Modification released a proposed decision that would deny the Petition for Modification. That proposed decision may be heard by the CPUC as soon as its March 17, 2022 business meeting. We cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings described above, but we intend to vigorously oppose any efforts to further delay the sunset of the legacy Sprint CDMA network. On August 12, 2021, we became aware of a potential cybersecurity issue involving unauthorized access to T-Mobile\u2019s systems (the \u201cAugust 2021 cyberattack\u201d). We immediately began an investigation and engaged cybersecurity experts to assist with the assessment of the incident and to help determine what data was impacted. Our investigation uncovered that the perpetrator had illegally gained access to certain areas of our systems on or about March 18, 2021, but only gained access to and took data of current, former, and prospective customers beginning on or about August 3, 2021. With the assistance of our outside cybersecurity experts, we located and closed the unauthorized access to our systems and identified current, former and prospective customers whose information was impacted and notified them, consistent with state and federal requirements. We also undertook a number of other measures to demonstrate our continued support and commitment to data privacy and protection. We also coordinated with law enforcement. Our forensic investigation is complete, and we believe we have a full view of the data compromised. As a result of the August 2021 cyberattack, we have become subject to numerous lawsuits, including multiple class action lawsuits, that have been filed in numerous jurisdictions seeking unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees arising out of the August 2021 cyberattack. In December 2021, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the federal class action lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri. In addition, in November 2021, a purported Company shareholder filed a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, Litwin v. Sievert et al., No. 2:21-cv-01599, against our current directors, alleging several claims concerning the Company\u2019s cybersecurity practices. We are also named as a nominal defendant in the lawsuit. We are unable to predict at this time the potential outcome of any of these claims or whether we may be subject to further private litigation. We intend to vigorously defend all of these lawsuits. In addition, the Company has received inquiries from various government agencies, law enforcement and other governmental authorities related to the August 2021 cyberattack, which could result in fines or penalties. We are responding to these inquiries and cooperating fully with regulators. However, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any of these inquiries, or whether we may be subject to further regulatory inquiries. In light of the inherent uncertainties involved in such matters and based on the information currently available to us, as of the date of this Annual Report, we have not recorded any accruals for losses related to the above proceedings and inquiries, as any such amounts (or ranges of amounts) are not probable or estimable at this time. We believe it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses associated with these proceedings and inquiries, and the Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred "]}, "Debt": {"Debt": ["Note 8 \u2013 Debt Debt was as follows: (in millions) December 31, December 31, 3.360% Series 2016-1 A-1 Notes due 2021 $ \u2014 $ 656 7.250% Senior Notes due 2021 \u2014 2,250 11.500% Senior Notes due 2021 \u2014 1,000 4.000% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2022 1,000 1,000 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022 500 500 5.375% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2022 1,250 1,250 6.000% Senior Notes due 2022 2,280 2,280 6.000% Senior Notes due 2023 \u2014 1,300 7.875% Senior Notes due 2023 4,250 4,250 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024 \u2014 1,000 7.125% Senior Notes due 2024 2,500 2,500 3.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 3,000 3,000 4.738% Series 2018-1 A-1 Notes due 2025 1,706 2,100 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 \u2014 500 7.625% Senior Notes due 2025 1,500 1,500 1.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 1,000 1,000 2.250% Senior Notes due 2026 1,800 \u2014 2.625% Senior Notes due 2026 1,200 \u2014 6.500% Senior Notes due 2026 \u2014 2,000 4.500% Senior Notes due 2026 \u2014 1,000 4.500% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2026 \u2014 1,000 7.625% Senior Notes due 2026 1,500 1,500 3.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 4,000 4,000 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 500 500 2.050% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 1,750 1,750 4.750% Senior Notes due 2028 1,500 1,500 4.750% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2028 1,500 1,500 5.152% Series 2018-1 A-2 Notes due 2028 1,838 1,838 6.875% Senior Notes due 2028 2,475 2,475 2.400% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 500 \u2014 2.625% Senior Notes due 2029 1,000 \u2014 3.375% Senior Notes due 2029 2,350 \u2014 3.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2030 7,000 7,000 2.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 1,000 1,000 2.550% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 2,500 2,500 2.875% Senior Notes due 2031 1,000 \u2014 3.500% Senior Notes due 2031 2,450 \u2014 2.700% Senior Secured Notes due 2032 1,000 \u2014 8.750% Senior Notes due 2032 2,000 2,000 4.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2040 2,000 2,000 3.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2041 2,500 2,500 4.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2050 3,000 3,000 3.300% Senior Secured Notes due 2051 3,000 3,000 3.400% Senior Secured Notes due 2052 2,800 \u2014 3.600% Senior Secured Notes due 2060 1,700 1,000 Other debt 47 240 Unamortized premium on debt to third parties 1,740 2,197 Unamortized discount on debt to affiliates (5) (20) Unamortized discount on debt to third parties (200) (197) Debt issuance costs and consent fees (238) (244) Total debt 74,193 71,125 Less: Current portion of Senior Notes to affiliates 2,245 \u2014 Less: Current portion of Senior Notes and other debt to third parties 3,378 4,579 Total long-term debt $ 68,570 $ 66,546 Classified on the consolidated balance sheets as: Long-term debt $ 67,076 $ 61,830 Long-term debt to affiliates 1,494 4,716 Total long-term debt $ 68,570 $ 66,546 Our effective interest rate, excluding the impact of derivatives and capitalized interest, was approximately 4.1% and 4.6% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, on weighted-average debt outstanding of $74.0 billion and $58.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25% with the margin subject to a reduction to 1.00% if T-Mobile\u2019s Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than or equal to 0.75 to 1.00. The commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on April 1, 2025. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including a financial maintenance covenant of 3.3x with respect to T-Mobile\u2019s Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio commencing with the period ending September 30, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we did not have an outstanding balance under this facility. On October 30, 2020, we entered into a $5.0 billion senior secured term loan commitment with certain financial institutions. On January 14, 2021, we issued an aggregate of $3.0 billion of Senior Notes. A portion of the senior secured term loan commitment was reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds of the Senior Notes, which reduced the commitment to $2.0 billion. On March 23, 2021, we issued an aggregate of $3.8 billion of Senior Notes. The senior secured term loan commitment was terminated upon the issuance of the $3.8 billion of Senior Notes. Senior Secured Notes On August 13, 2021, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued an aggregate $2.0 billion of Senior Secured Notes bearing interest at 3.400% and 3.600%, respectively, and maturing in 2052 and 2060, respectively. We used the net proceeds of $2.0 billion, together with cash on hand, to redeem our 4.500% Senior Notes due 2026 held by DT and our 4.500% Senior Notes due 2026 held by public investors. On December 6, 2021, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued an aggregate of $3.0 billion of Senior Secured Notes bearing interest rates ranging from 2.400% to 3.400% and maturing in 2029 through 2052, and used the net proceeds of such issuances for general corporate purposes, which may include among other things, financing acquisitions of additional spectrum and refinancing existing indebtedness on an ongoing basis. The Senior Secured Notes issued in 2021 have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in accordance with an applicable exemption from the registration requirements thereof. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes were offered and sold only (1) to persons reasonably believed to be \u201cqualified institutional buyers\u201d under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (2) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Senior Secured Notes are secured by a first priority security interest, subject to permitted liens, in substantially all of our present and future assets, other than certain excluded assets. They are redeemable at our discretion, in whole or in part, at any time. If redeemed prior to their contractually specified par call date, the redemption price is subject to a make-whole premium calculated by reference to then-current U.S. Treasury rates plus a fixed spread; if redeemed on or after their respective par call date, the make-whole premium does not apply. The amount of time by which the par call date precedes the maturity date of the respective series of Senior Secured Notes varies from one We have entered into Registration Rights Agreements that are in effect through the maturity of the applicable Senior Secured Notes issued in 2021. These agreements call for us to use commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement and have it declared effective within a particular time period and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a certain period of time. If a default occurs, we will pay additional interest up to a maximum increase of 0.50% per annum. We have not accrued any obligations associated with the Registration Rights Agreements as compliance with the agreements is considered probable. In 2021, we exchanged the Senior Secured Notes issued in 2020, which were not registered under the Securities Act, for substantially identical Senior Secured Notes that were registered under the Securities Act. Senior Notes On January 14, 2021, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued an aggregate of $3.0 billion of Senior Notes bearing interest ranging from 2.250% to 2.875% and maturing in 2026 through 2031, and used the net proceeds of $3.0 billion for general corporate purposes, including among other things, the acquisition of additional spectrum and the refinancing of existing indebtedness subsequent to issuance. On March 23, 2021, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued an aggregate of $3.8 billion of Senior Notes bearing interest ranging from 2.625% to 3.500% and maturing in 2026 through 2031, and used the net proceeds of $3.8 billion to acquire spectrum licenses pursuant to the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s C-Band spectrum Auction 107, with the remainder used, together with cash on hand, to redeem T-Mobile USA\u2019s 6.500% Senior Notes due 2026. On May 13, 2021, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued an aggregate of $3.0 billion of Senior Notes bearing interest ranging from 2.250% to 3.500% and maturing in 2026 through 2031, and used the net proceeds of $3.0 billion to redeem our 6.000% Senior Notes due 2023, 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024, and 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 with the remainder used to refinance existing indebtedness subsequent to issuance. The Senior Notes issued in May 2021 have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in accordance with an applicable exception from the registration requirements thereof. Accordingly, the Senior Notes issued in May 2021 were offered and sold only (1) to persons reasonably believed to be \u201cqualified institutional buyers\u201d under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (2) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries. They are redeemable at our discretion, in whole or in part, at any time. If redeemed prior to their contractually specified applicable premium end date, the redemption price is subject to a premium calculated by reference to then-current U.S. Treasury rates plus a fixed spread; if redeemed on or after their respective applicable premium end date, they are redeemable at a contractually specified fixed premium that steps down gradually as the Senior Notes approach their par call date, on or after which they are redeemable at par. The amount of time by which the par call date precedes the maturity date of the respective series of Senior Notes varies from one We have entered into a Registration Rights Agreement that is in effect through the maturity of the Senior Notes issued in May 2021. This agreement calls for us to use commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement and have it declared effective within a particular time period and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a certain period of time. If a default occurs, we will pay additional interest up to a maximum increase of 0.50% per annum. We have not accrued any obligations associated with the Registration Rights Agreement as compliance with the agreements is considered probable.

Write-off of issuance costs and consent fees are included in Loss on redemption of debt within Net cash provided by operating activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. (2) The redemption premium is the excess paid over the principal amount. Redemption premiums are included in Other expense, net on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and in Net cash used in financing activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Our losses on extinguishment of debt were $184 million, $371 million, and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in Other expense, net on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Spectrum Financing On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed Sprint\u2019s spectrum-backed notes, which are collateralized by the acquired directly held and third-party leased Spectrum licenses (collectively, the \u201cSpectrum Portfolio\u201d) transferred to wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities (collectively, the \u201cSpectrum Financing SPEs\u201d). As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total outstanding obligations under these Notes was $3.5 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. In October 2016, certain subsidiaries of Sprint Communications, Inc. transferred the Spectrum Portfolio to the Spectrum Financing SPEs, which was used as collateral to raise an initial $3.5 billion in senior secured notes (the \u201c2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes\u201d) bearing interest at 3.360% per annum under a $7.0 billion securitization program. The 2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes were repayable over a five-year term, with interest-only payments over the first four quarters and amortizing quarterly principal payments thereafter commencing December 2017 through September 2021. We fully repaid the 2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes in 2021. In March 2018, Sprint issued approximately $3.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (the \u201c2018 Spectrum-Backed Notes\u201d and together with the 2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes, the \u201cSpectrum-Backed Notes\u201d) under the existing $7.0 billion securitization program, consisting of two series of senior secured notes. The first series of notes totaled $2.1 billion in aggregate principal amount, bears interest at 4.738% per annum, and has quarterly interest-only payments until June 2021, and amortizing quarterly principal amounts thereafter commencing in June 2021 through March 2025. As of December 31, 2021, $525 million of the aggregate principal amount was classified as Short-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The second series of notes totaled approximately $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount, bears interest at 5.152% per annum, and has quarterly interest-only payments until June 2023, and amortizing quarterly principal amounts thereafter commencing in June 2023 through March 2028. The Spectrum Portfolio, which also serves as collateral for the Spectrum-Backed Notes, remains substantially identical to the original portfolio from October 2016. Simultaneously with the October 2016 offering, Sprint Communications, Inc. entered a long-term lease with the Spectrum Financing SPEs for the ongoing use of the Spectrum Portfolio. Sprint Communications, Inc. is required to make monthly lease payments to the Spectrum Financing SPEs in an aggregate amount that is market-based relative to the spectrum usage rights as of the closing date and equal to $165 million per month. The lease payments, which are guaranteed by T-Mobile subsidiaries subsequent to the Merger, are sufficient to service all outstanding series of the 2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes and the lease also constitutes collateral for the senior secured notes. Because the Spectrum Financing SPEs are wholly-owned T-Mobile subsidiaries subsequent to the Merger, these entities are consolidated and all intercompany activity has been eliminated. Each Spectrum Financing SPE is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled, prior to and upon the liquidation of the respective Spectrum Financing SPE, to be satisfied out of the Spectrum Financing SPE\u2019s assets prior to any assets of such Spectrum Financing SPE becoming available to T-Mobile. Accordingly, the assets of each Spectrum Financing SPE are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations owed to other creditors of T-Mobile until the obligations of such Spectrum Financing SPE under the spectrum-backed senior secured notes are paid in full. Certain provisions of the Spectrum Financing facility require us to maintain specified cash collateral balances. Amounts associated with these balances are considered to be restricted cash. Restricted Cash Certain provisions of our debt agreements require us to maintain specified cash collateral balances. Amounts associated with these balances are considered to be restricted cash. Standby Letters of Credit For the purposes of securing our obligations to provide device insurance services and for the purposes of securing our general purpose obligations, we maintain an agreement for standby letters of credit with certain financial institutions. We assumed certain of Sprint\u2019s standby letters of credit in the Merger. Our outstanding standby letters of credit were $441 million and $555 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively."]}, "external_audit": "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of T-Mobile US, Inc. \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, of stockholders\u2019 equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nChange in Accounting Principle \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit \n\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nRevenue Recognition - Equipment revenues \n\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s revenue includes equipment revenues of $20,727 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which are generated from the sale or lease of mobile communication devices and accessories. For performance obligations related to equipment contracts, the Company typically transfers control at a point in time when the device or accessory is delivered to, and accepted by, the customer or dealer. Management estimates variable consideration (e.g., device returns or certain payments to indirect dealers) primarily based on historical experience. Promotional equipment installment plan bill credits offered to a customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether a substantive penalty is deemed to exist. Lease revenues are recorded as equipment revenues and recognized as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition of equipment revenues is a critical audit matter are the significant auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the accuracy and existence of equipment revenues recognized. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the accuracy and existence of equipment revenues recognized. These procedures also included, among others, testing the accuracy and existence of revenue recognized on a test basis by (i) obtaining and inspecting, where applicable, invoices, customer contracts, shipping documents, and cash receipts from customers, and (ii) evaluating reductions to revenues and accruals for promotional bill credits based upon the terms and conditions of the arrangements. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nFebruary 11, 2022 \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2001. \n\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nT-Mobile US, Inc. \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n\n (in millions, except share and per share amounts) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 6,631 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1283699/000128369922000018/tmus-20211231.htm"}, "2020": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business T-Mobile US, Inc.

Substantially all of our revenues were earned in, and substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in, the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We provide mobile communications services primarily using our 4G Long-Term Evolution (\u201cLTE\u201d) network and our 5G technology network. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including handsets, tablets and other mobile communication devices, and accessories for sale, as well as financing through Equipment Installment Plans (\u201cEIP\u201d) and leasing through JUMP! On Demand\u2122. Additionally, we provide reinsurance for device insurance policies and extended warranty contracts offered to our mobile communications customers. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the balances and results of operations of T-Mobile and our consolidated subsidiaries. We consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, as well as variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and VIEs, which cannot be deconsolidated, such as those related to Tower obligations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. We operate as a single operating segment. On April 29, 2018, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the \u201cBusiness Combination Agreement\u201d) to merge with Sprint Corporation (\u201cSprint\u201d) in an all-stock transaction at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile common stock for each share of Sprint common stock, or 9.75 shares of Sprint common stock for each share of T-Mobile common stock (the \u201cMerger\u201d). On April 1, 2020, we completed the Merger and acquired Sprint (see Note 2 - Business Combination ). On July 26, 2019, pursuant to the requirement as set forth in the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) complaint and proposed final judgement (the \u201cConsent Decree\u201d), T-Mobile entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Sprint and DISH Network Corporation (\u201cDISH\u201d). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, on July 1, 2020, DISH acquired the prepaid wireless business operated under the Boost Mobile and Sprint prepaid brands (excluding the Assurance brand Lifeline customers and the prepaid wireless customers of Shenandoah Telecommunications Company and Swiftel Communications, Inc.), including customer accounts, inventory, contracts, intellectual property and certain other specified assets (the \u201cPrepaid Business\u201d) and assumed certain related liabilities (the \u201cPrepaid Transaction\u201d). Upon closing of the Prepaid Transaction, we received $1.4 billion from DISH, subject to a working capital adjustment. The revenues and expenses of the Prepaid Business are presented as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including but not limited to the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed through the Merger with Sprint and the potential impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic (the \u201cPandemic\u201d). These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. Business Combination Assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset or liability. See N ote 2 \u2013 Business Combination for further discussion of the Merger between T-Mobile and Sprint. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts currently due from customers (e.g., for wireless services and monthly device lease payments), device insurance administrators, wholesale partners, other carriers and third-party retail channels. Accounts receivable are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amortized cost basis (i.e., the receivables\u2019 outstanding principal balance adjusted for any write-offs), net of the allowance for expected credit losses. We have an arrangement to sell certain of our customer service accounts receivable on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. Equipment Installment Plan Receivables We offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments, generally over a period of 24 months using an EIP. EIP receivables are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amortized cost basis (i.e., the receivables\u2019 unpaid principal balance adjusted for any write-offs and unamortized discounts), net of the allowance for expected credit losses. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest if the term exceeds 12 months as there is no stated rate of interest on the receivables. The receivables are recorded at their present value, which is determined by discounting expected future cash payments at the imputed interest rate. This adjustment results in a discount or reduction in transaction price which is allocated to the performance obligations and reduces Service revenues and Equipment revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The imputed discount rate is the current market interest rate and is predominately comprised of the estimated credit risk underlying the EIP receivable, reflecting the estimated credit worthiness of the customer. The imputed discount on receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The current portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables, net and the long-term portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have an arrangement to sell certain EIP receivables on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. Allowance for Credit Losses We maintain an allowance for expected credit losses and determine its appropriateness through an established process that assesses the lifetime credit losses that we expect to incur related to our receivable portfolio. Our process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique risk characteristics of our accounts receivable and EIP receivable portfolio segments. For each portfolio segment, losses are estimated collectively for groups of receivables with similar characteristics. Our allowance levels are influenced by receivable volumes, receivable delinquency status, historical loss experience and other conditions that affect loss expectations, such as changes in credit and collections policies and forecasts of macro-economic conditions. While we attribute portions of the allowance to our respective accounts receivable and EIP portfolio segments, the entire allowance is available to credit losses related to the total receivable portfolio. We consider a receivable past due and delinquent when a customer has not paid us by the contractually specified payment due date. Account balances are written off against the allowance for credit losses if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible (customer default), based on factors such as customer credit ratings as well as the length of time the amounts are past due. If there is a deterioration of our customers\u2019 financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we will adjust our allowance for credit losses accordingly, which may materially affect our financial results in the period the adjustments are made. Inventories Inventories consist primarily of wireless devices and accessories, which are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using standard cost which approximates average cost. Shipping and handling costs paid to wireless device and accessories vendors as well as costs to refurbish used devices are included in the standard cost of inventory. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of disposal and transportation. We record inventory write-downs to net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving items based on inventory turnover trends and historical experience. Deferred Purchase Price Assets In connection with the sales of certain service and EIP accounts receivable pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable Level 3 inputs, including estimated customer default rates and credit worthiness. See Note 4 \u2013 Sales of Certain Receivables for further information. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets include assets that do not have indefinite lives, such as property and equipment and other intangible assets. Substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the U.S., including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indicators of impairment are present, we test recoverability. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the asset or asset group\u2019s carrying amount, then an impairment loss is recorded, measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of buildings and equipment, wireless communications systems, leasehold improvements, capitalized software, leased wireless devices and construction in progress. Buildings and equipment include certain network server equipment. Wireless communications systems include assets to operate our wireless network and IT data centers, including tower assets and leasehold improvements and assets related to the liability for the retirement of long-lived assets. Leasehold improvements include asset improvements other than those related to the wireless network. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments, if any, in Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit using the straight-line method. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book value is depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease term. Costs of major replacements and improvements are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures which do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Construction costs, labor and overhead incurred in the expansion or enhancement of our wireless network are capitalized. Capitalization commences with pre-construction period administrative and technical activities, which include obtaining zoning approvals and building permits, and ceases at the point at which the asset is ready for its intended use. We capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of certain property and equipment. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated over the useful life of the related assets. We record an asset retirement obligation for the estimated fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, we recognize changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. Our obligations relate primarily to certain legal obligations to remediate leased property on which our network infrastructure and administrative assets are located. We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or acquiring internal use software. Capitalization of software costs commences once the final selection of the specific software solution has been made and management authorizes and commits to funding the software project and ceases once the project is ready for its intended use. Capitalized software costs are included in Property and equipment, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. Device Leases Through the Merger, we acquired device lease contracts in which Sprint is the lessor (the \u201cSprint Flex Lease Program\u201d), substantially all of which are classified as operating leases, as well as the associated fixed assets (i.e., the leased devices). These leased devices were recorded as fixed assets at their acquisition date fair value and presented within Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our leasing programs (\u201cLeasing Programs\u201d), which include JUMP! On Demand and the Sprint Flex Lease Program acquired through the Merger, allow customers to lease a device (handset or tablet) over a period of, generally, 18 months and upgrade it for a new device when eligibility requirements are met. We depreciate leased devices to their estimated residual value, on a group basis, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the device. The estimated useful life reflects the period for which we estimate the group of leased devices will provide utility to us, which may be longer than the initial lease term based on customer options in the Sprint Flex Lease program to renew the lease on a month-to-month basis after the initial lease term concludes. In determining the estimated useful life, we consider the lease term (e.g., 18 months and month-to-month renewal options for the Sprint Flex Lease Program), trade-in activity and write-offs for lost and stolen devices. Lost and stolen devices are incorporated into the estimates of depreciation expense and recognized as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation when the loss event occurs. Our policy of using the group method of depreciation has been applied to acquired leased devices as well as leases originated subsequent to the Merger. Acquired leased devices are grouped based on the age of the device. Revenues associated with the leased wireless devices, net of lease incentives, are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For arrangements in which we are the lessor of wireless devices, we separate lease and non-lease components. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers in the JUMP! On Demand lease program must return or purchase their device, and customers in the Sprint Flex Lease Program have the option to return or purchase their device or to renew their lease on a month-to-month basis. The purchase price of the device is established at lease commencement and is based on the type of device leased and any down payment made. The Leasing Programs do not contain any residual value guarantees or variable lease payments, and there are no restrictions or covenants imposed by these leases. Returned devices, including those received upon device upgrade, are transferred from Property and equipment, net to Inventory on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with any write-down recognized as Cost of equipment sales in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets that do not have indefinite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Customer lists and the Sprint trade name are amortized using the sum-of-the-years digits method over the period in which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. The remaining finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is allocated to our two reporting units, wireless and Layer3. Spectrum Licenses Spectrum licenses are carried at costs incurred to acquire the spectrum licenses and the costs to prepare the spectrum licenses for their intended use, such as costs to clear acquired spectrum licenses. The Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) issues spectrum licenses which provide us with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum within specific geographic service areas to provide wireless communications services. While spectrum licenses are issued for a fixed period of time, typically for up to 15 years, the FCC has granted license renewals routinely and at a nominal cost. The spectrum licenses held by us expire at various dates. We believe we will be able to meet all requirements necessary to secure renewal of our spectrum licenses at nominal costs. Moreover, we determined there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our spectrum licenses. Therefore, we determined the spectrum licenses should be treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets. At times, we enter into agreements to sell or exchange spectrum licenses. Upon entering into the arrangement, if the transaction has been deemed to have commercial substance, spectrum licenses are reviewed for impairment. The licenses are transferred at their carrying value, as adjusted for any impairment recognized, to assets held for sale, which is included in Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until approval and completion of the exchange or sale. Upon closing of the transaction, spectrum licenses acquired as part of an exchange of nonmonetary assets are recorded at fair value and the difference between the fair value of the spectrum licenses obtained, carrying value of the spectrum licenses transferred and cash paid, if any, is recognized as a Gain (loss) on disposal of spectrum licenses included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Our fair value estimates of spectrum licenses are based on information for which there is little or no observable market data. If the transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value is not measurable, the acquired spectrum licenses are recorded at our carrying value of the spectrum assets transferred or exchanged. Spectrum Leases Through the Merger, the Company acquired lease agreements (the \u201cAgreements\u201d) with various educational and non-profit institutions that provide us with the right to use FCC spectrum licenses (Educational Broadband Services or \u201cEBS spectrum\u201d) in the 2.5 GHz band. In addition to the Agreements with educational institutions and private owners who hold the licenses, the Company also acquired direct ownership of spectrum licenses previously acquired by Sprint through government auctions or other acquisitions. The Agreements with educational and certain non-profit institutions are typically for five Leased FCC spectrum licenses are recorded as executory contracts whereby, as a result of business combination accounting, an intangible asset or liability is recorded reflecting the extent to which contractual terms are favorable or unfavorable to current market rates. These intangible assets or liabilities are amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the lease agreements. Contractual lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the arrangement, including renewals, and are presented in Costs of services within our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The Agreements enhance the overall value of the Company\u2019s owned spectrum licenses as the collective value is higher than the value of individual bands of spectrum within a specific geography. This value is derived from the ability to provide wireless service to customers across large geographic areas and maintain the same or similar wireless connectivity quality. This enhanced value from combining owned and leased spectrum licenses is referred to as an aggregation premium. The aggregation premium is a component of the overall fair value of our owned FCC spectrum licenses, which are recorded as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment We assess the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired. When assessing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the two reporting units, wireless and Layer3, is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We test our spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. If the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. We estimate fair value using the Greenfield methodology, which is an income approach based on discounted cash flows associated with the intangible asset, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Restricted Cash Certain provisions of our debt agreements require us to maintain specified cash collateral balances. Amounts associated with these balances are considered to be restricted cash and are included within Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Guarantee Liabilities We offer a device trade-in program, Just Upgrade My Phone (\u201cJUMP!\u201d), which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. Upon enrollment, participating customers must finance the purchase of a device on an EIP and have a qualifying T-Mobile monthly wireless service plan. Upon a qualifying JUMP! program upgrade, the customer\u2019s remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade-in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new EIP. For customers who enroll in JUMP!, we recognize a liability and reduce revenue for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which requires judgment, including estimating the customer's remaining EIP balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and the probability and timing of trade-in. When customers upgrade their device, the difference between the EIP balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. All assumptions are reviewed periodically. Fair Value Measurements We carry certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs based on the observability as of the measurement date, is as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; and Level 3 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities being measured within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts receivable, Accounts receivable from affiliates, Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and borrowings under our vendor financing arrangements approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying values of EIP receivables approximate fair value as the receivables are recorded at their present value using an imputed interest rate. With the exception of certain long-term fixed-rate debt, there were no financial instruments with a carrying value materially different from their fair value. See Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements for a comparison of the carrying values and fair values of our short-term and long-term debt. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges associated with forecasted debt issuances, changes in fair value are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until reclassified into Interest expense in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, generally over the life of the related debt. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated in qualifying cash flow hedge relationships are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recorded at fair value as liabilities. Revenue Recognition (Effective January 1, 2018) We primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless services to customers and selling or leasing devices and accessories. Our contracts with customers may involve multiple performance obligations, which include wireless services, wireless devices or a combination thereof, and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Significant Judgments The most significant judgments affecting the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with our customers include the following items: \u2022 Revenue for service contracts that we assess are not probable of collection is not recognized until the contract is completed or terminated and cash is received. Collectibility is re-assessed when there is a significant change in facts or circumstances. Our assessment of collectibility considers whether we may limit our exposure to credit risk through our right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent as well as certain contract terms such as down payments that reduce our exposure to credit risk. Customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. See \u201cReceivables and Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d above, for additional discussion on how we assess credit risk. \u2022 Promotional EIP bill credits offered to a customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether a substantive penalty is deemed to exist. Determining whether contingent EIP bill credits result in a substantive termination penalty may require significant judgment. \u2022 The identification of distinct performance obligations within our service plans may require significant judgment. \u2022 Revenue is recorded net of costs paid to another party for performance obligations where we arrange for the other party to transfer goods or services to the customer (i.e., when we are acting as an agent). For example, performance obligations relating to services provided by third-party content providers where we neither control a right to the content provider\u2019s service nor control the underlying service itself are presented net because we are acting as an agent. The determination of whether we control the underlying service or right to the service prior to our transfer to the customer requires, at times, significant judgment. \u2022 Our products are generally sold with a right of return, which is accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Device return levels are estimated based on the expected value method as there are a large number of contracts with similar characteristics and the outcome of each contract is independent of the others. Historical return rate experience is a significant input to our expected value methodology. \u2022 Sales of equipment to indirect dealers who have been identified as our customer (referred to as the sell-in model) often include credits subsequently paid to the dealer as a reimbursement for any discount promotions offered to the end consumer. These credits (payments to a customer, the dealer) are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize from the sales of equipment to indirect dealers and are estimated based on historical experience and other factors, such as expected promotional activity. \u2022 The determination of the standalone selling price for contracts that involve more than one performance obligation may require significant judgment, such as when the selling price of a good or service is not readily observable. Wireless Services Revenue We generate our wir"]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["Note 18 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments We have commitments for non-dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms that generally extend through 2029. In addition, we have commitments to purchase wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business, with various terms through 2043. Our purchase commitments, including purchase commitments assumed through the Merger, are approximately $5.0 billion for the year ending December 31, 2021, $4.5 billion in total for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2023, $2.4 billion in total for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025 and $1.7 billion in total for the years thereafter. These amounts are not reflective of our entire anticipated purchases under the related agreements but are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually obligated. Spectrum Leases In connection with the Merger, we assumed certain spectrum lease contracts from Sprint that include service obligations to the lessors. Certain of the spectrum leases provide for minimum lease payments, additional charges, renewal options and escalation clauses. Leased spectrum agreements have varying expiration terms that generally extend through 2050. We expect that all renewal periods in our spectrum leases will be exercised by us. Our spectrum lease and service credit commitments, including renewal periods, are approximately $338 million for the year ending December 31, 2021, $675 million in total for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2023, $594 million in total for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025 and $5.1 billion in total for the years thereafter. We accrue a monthly obligation for the services and equipment based on the total estimated available service credits divided by the term of the lease. The obligation is reduced by services provided and as actual invoices are presented and paid to the lessors. The maximum remaining service commitment on December 31, 2020 was $92 million and is expected to be incurred over the term of the related lease agreements, which generally range from 15 to 30 years. Merger Commitments In connection with the regulatory proceedings and approvals of the Transactions, we have commitments and other obligations to various state and federal agencies and certain nongovernmental organizations, including pursuant to the Consent Decree agreed to by us, DT, Sprint, SoftBank and DISH and entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and the FCC\u2019s memorandum opinion and order approving our applications for approval of the Merger. These commitments and obligations include, among other things, extensive 5G network build-out commitments, obligations to deliver high-speed wireless services to the vast majority of Americans, including Americans residing in rural areas, and the marketing of an in-home broadband product where spectrum capacity is available. Other commitments relate to national security, pricing, service, employment and support of diversity initiatives. Many of the commitments specify time frames for compliance. Failure to fulfill our obligations and commitments in a timely manner could result in substantial fines, penalties, or other legal and administrative actions. We expect that our monetary commitments associated with these matters are approximately $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, $37 million in total for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 and $13 million in total for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2025. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated costs to achieve specified network coverage and performance requirements, employment targets or commitments to provide access to affordable rate plans, but represent only those amounts for which we are required to make a specified payment in connection with our commitments or settlements. Contingencies and Litigation Litigation Matters We are involved in various lawsuits and disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings (\u201cLitigation Matters\u201d) that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include claims of patent infringement (most of which are asserted by non-practicing entities primarily seeking monetary damages), class actions, and proceedings to enforce FCC rules and regulations. Those Litigation Matters are at various stages, and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing, or other adjudication that could result in fines, penalties, or awards of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. We have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate, which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements but that is not considered to be, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where we have not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we have not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including, but not limited to, uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators, uncertain damage theories and demands, and a less than fully developed factual record. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these Litigation Matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, but we note that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the specific matters identified below could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future. On February 28, 2020, we received a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Admonishment from the FCC, which proposed a penalty against us for allegedly violating section 222 of the Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s regulations governing the privacy of customer information. We recorded an accrual for an estimated payment amount as of December 31, 2020, which was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed the contingencies and litigation matters of Sprint. Those matters include a wide variety of disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings. These matters include, among other things, certain ongoing FCC and state government agency investigations into Sprint\u2019s Lifeline program. In September 2019, Sprint notified the FCC that it had claimed monthly subsidies for serving subscribers even though these subscribers may not have met usage requirements under Sprint's usage policy for the Lifeline program, due to an inadvertent coding issue in the system used to identify qualifying subscriber usage that occurred in July 2017 while the system was being updated. Sprint has made a number of payments to reimburse the federal government and certain states for excess subsidy payments. Resolution of these matters could require making additional reimbursements and paying additional fines and penalties. In November 2020, we entered into a consent decree with the FCC to resolve certain of these Lifeline matters, which resulted in a payment of $200 million by SoftBank. We note that pursuant to Amendment No. 2 to the Business Combination Agreement, SoftBank agreed to indemnify us against certain specified matters and losses, including those relating to these Lifeline matters. As of December 31, 2020, we have recorded a contingent liability and an offsetting indemnification asset for the expected reimbursement by SoftBank for certain Lifeline matters which have not been resolved. We expect that any additional liabilities related to these indemnified matters would be indemnified and reimbursed by SoftBank.

Our effective interest rate, excluding the impact of derivatives and capitalized interest, was approximately 4.6% and 5.2% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on weighted average debt outstanding of $58.4 billion and $25.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The weighted average debt outstanding was calculated by applying an average of the monthly ending balances of total short-term and long-term debt and short-term and long-term debt to affiliates, net of unamortized premiums, discounts, debt issuance costs and consent fees.

The New Secured Term Loan Facility had an interest rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 3.00% and had a maturity date of April 1, 2027.

On October 30, 2020, we entered into a $5.0 billion senior secured term loan commitment with certain financial institutions. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, on January 14, 2021, we issued an aggregate of $3.0 billion in Senior Notes. A portion of the senior secured term loan commitment was reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds of the Senior Notes, which reduced the commitment to $2.0 billion. Up to $2.0 billion of loans under the commitment may be drawn at any time (subject to customary conditions precedent) through June 30, 2021.

We intend to use the net proceeds of $4.6 billion for general corporate purposes, which may include among other things, acquisitions of additional spectrum and refinancing existing indebtedness on an ongoing basis. The Senior Secured Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in accordance with an applicable exemption from the registration requirements thereof. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes were offered and sold only (1) to persons reasonably believed to be \u201cqualified institutional buyers\u201d under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (2) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Senior Secured Notes are secured by a first priority security interest, subject to permitted liens, in substantially all of our present and future assets, other than certain excluded assets. They are redeemable at our discretion, in whole or in part, at any time. If redeemed prior to their contractually specified Par Call Date, the redemption price is subject to a make-whole premium calculated by reference to then-current U.S. Treasury rates plus a fixed spread; if redeemed on or after their respective Par Call Date, the make-whole premium does not apply. The amount of time by which the Par Call Date precedes the maturity date of the respective note varies from one We have entered into a Registration Rights Agreement that is in effect through the maturity of the applicable Senior Secured Notes. This agreement calls for us to use commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement and have it declared effective within a particular time period and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a certain period of time. If a default occurs, we will pay additional interest up to a maximum increase of 0.50% per annum.

Financing Matters Agreement Pursuant to the Financing Matters Agreement, DT agreed, among other things, to consent to the incurrence by T-Mobile USA of secured debt in connection with and after the consummation of the Merger, and to provide a lock up on sales thereby as to certain Senior Notes of T-Mobile USA held thereby. In connection with receiving the requisite consents, we made upfront payments to DT of $7 million during the second quarter of 2018. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt to affiliates in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we: \u2022 Repaid our $4.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility with DT, consisting of a $2.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility due 2022 and a $2.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility due 2024; \u2022 Terminated our revolving credit facility; \u2022 Repurchased from DT $4.0 billion of indebtedness to affiliates, consisting of $2.0 billion of 5.300% Senior Notes due 2021 and $2.0 billion of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024; \u2022 Amended the $1.25 billion of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 and $1.25 billion of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027, which represent indebtedness to affiliates, to change the maturity dates thereof to April 15, 2021 and April 15, 2022, respectively (the \u201c2025 and 2027 Amendments\u201d); and \u2022 Made an additional payment for requisite consents to DT of $13 million. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt to affiliates in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In accordance with the consents received from DT, on December 20, 2018, T-Mobile USA, the guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, executed and delivered the 38 th supplemental indenture to the Indenture, pursuant to which, with respect to certain T-Mobile USA Senior Notes held by DT, the Debt Amendments (as defined below under \u201cConsents on Debt to Third Parties\u201d) and the 2025 and 2027 Amendments became effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. Senior Notes to Affiliates On July 4, 2020, we redeemed $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5.125% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2021. The notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100.00% of the principal amount of the notes (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon), and were paid on July 6, 2020. The write off of discounts was approximately $15 million and was included in Other expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Losses on redemption of debt in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Consents on Debt to Third Parties On May 18, 2018, under the terms and conditions described in the Consent Solicitation Statement, we obtained consents necessary to effect certain amendments to our Senior Notes to third parties in connection with the Business Combination Agreement. Pursuant to the Consent Solicitation Statement, third-party note holders agreed, among other things, to consent to increasing the amount of Secured Indebtedness under credit facilities that can be incurred from the greater of $9.0 billion and 150% of Consolidated Cash Flow to the greater of $9.0 billion and an amount that would not cause the Secured Debt to Cash Flow Ratio (calculated net of cash and cash equivalents) to exceed 2.00x (the \u201cRatio Secured Debt Amendments\u201d) and in each case as such capitalized term is defined in the Indenture. In connection with receiving the requisite consents for the Ratio Secured Debt Amendments, we made upfront payments to third-party note holders of $17 million during the second quarter of 2018. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These upfront payments increased the effective interest rate of the related debt. In addition, note holders agreed, among other things, to allow certain entities related to Sprint\u2019s existing spectrum securitization notes program (\u201cExisting Sprint Spectrum Program\u201d) to be non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, provided that the principal amount of the spectrum notes issued and outstanding under the Existing Sprint Spectrum Program does not exceed $7.0 billion and that the principal amount of such spectrum notes reduces the amount available under the credit facilities ratio basket, and to revise the definition of GAAP to mean generally accepted accounting principles in effect from time to time, unless the Company elects to \u201cfreeze\u201d GAAP as of any date, and to exclude the effect of the changes in the accounting treatment of lease obligations (the \u201cExisting Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Amendments,\u201d and together with the Ratio Secured Debt Amendments, the \u201cDebt Amendments\u201d). In connection with receiving the requisite consents for the Existing Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Amendments, we made upfront payments to third-party note holders of $14 million during the second quarter of 2018. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These upfront payments increased the effective interest rate of the related debt. In connection with obtaining the requisite consents, on May 20, 2018, T-Mobile USA, the guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, executed and delivered the 37 th supplemental indenture to the Indenture, pursuant to which, with respect to each of our Senior Notes to third parties, all the amendments mentioned above (collectively, the \u201cDebt Amendments\u201d) would become effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. We paid third-party bank fees associated with obtaining the requisite consents related to the Debt Amendments of $6 million during the second quarter of 2018, which we recognized as Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we made additional payments to third-party note holders for requisite consents related to the Ratio Secured Debt Amendments of $54 million and related to the Existing Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Amendments of $41 million. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These payments increased the effective interest rate of the related debt. Spectrum Financing On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed Sprint\u2019s spectrum-backed notes, which are collateralized by the acquired directly held and third-party leased Spectrum licenses (collectively, the \u201cSpectrum Portfolio\u201c) transferred to wholly owned bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities (collectively, the \u201cSpectrum Financing SPEs\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, the total outstanding obligations under these Notes was $4.6 billion. In October 2016, certain subsidiaries of Sprint Communications, Inc. transferred the Spectrum Portfolio to the Spectrum Financing SPEs, which was used as collateral to raise an initial $3.5 billion in senior secured notes (the \u201c2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes\u201d) bearing interest at 3.360% per annum under a $7.0 billion securitization program. The 2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes are repayable over a five-year term, with interest-only payments over the first four quarters and amortizing quarterly principal payments thereafter commencing December 2017 through September 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we made scheduled principal repayments of $656 million, resulting in a total principal amount outstanding related to the 2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes of $656 million as of December 31, 2020, which was classified as Short-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets . In March 2018, Sprint issued approximately $3.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (the \u201c2018 Spectrum-Backed Notes\u201d and together with the 2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes, the \u201cSpectrum-Backed Notes\u201d) under the existing $7.0 billion securitization program, consisting of two series of senior secured notes. The first series of notes totaled $2.1 billion in aggregate principal amount, bears interest at 4.738% per annum, and has quarterly interest-only payments until June 2021, and amortizing quarterly principal amounts thereafter commencing in June 2021 through March 2025. As of December 31, 2020, $394 million of the aggregate principal amount was classified as Short-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The second series of notes totaled approximately $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount, bears interest at 5.152% per annum, and has quarterly interest-only payments until June 2023, and amortizing quarterly principal amounts thereafter commencing in June 2023 through March 2028. The Spectrum Portfolio, which also serves as collateral for the Spectrum-Backed Notes, remains substantially identical to the original portfolio from October 2016. Simultaneously with the October 2016 offering, Sprint Communications, Inc. entered a long-term lease with the Spectrum Financing SPEs for the ongoing use of the Spectrum Portfolio. Sprint Communications, Inc. is required to make monthly lease payments to the Spectrum Financing SPEs in an aggregate amount that is market-based relative to the spectrum usage rights as of the closing date and equal to $165 million per month. The lease payments, which are guaranteed by T-Mobile subsidiaries, are sufficient to service all outstanding series of the 2016 Spectrum Backed Notes and the lease also constitutes collateral for the senior secured notes. Because the Spectrum Financing SPEs are wholly owned T-Mobile subsidiaries, these entities are consolidated and all intercompany activity has been eliminated. Each Spectrum Financing SPE is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled, prior to and upon the liquidation of the respective Spectrum Financing SPE, to be satisfied out of the Spectrum Financing SPE\u2019s assets prior to any assets of such Spectrum Financing SPE becoming available to T-Mobile. Accordingly, the assets of each Spectrum Financing SPE are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations owed to other creditors of T-Mobile until the obligations of such Spectrum Financing SPE under the spectrum-backed senior secured notes are paid in full. Certain provisions of the Spectrum Financing facility require us to maintain specified cash collateral balances. Amounts associated with these balances are considered to be restricted cash. Restricted Cash Certain provisions of our debt agreements require us to maintain specified cash collateral balances. Amounts associated with these balances are considered to be restricted cash.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nChanges in Accounting Principles \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues in 2018. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nAs described in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded certain elements of the internal control over financial reporting of Sprint from its assessment of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2020. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company integrated certain elements of Sprint\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and related processes into the Company\u2019s existing systems, internal control over financial reporting and related processes. The Sprint controls that were not integrated have been excluded from management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. We have also excluded these elements of the internal \n\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\ncontrol over financial reporting of Sprint from our audit of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. The excluded elements of Sprint represent controls over approximately 14% of consolidated assets and approximately 30% of the consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nAcquisition of Sprint Corporation - Accounting and Valuation of the Acquired Spectrum License Portfolio \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed its acquisition of Sprint Corporation for a total consideration of $40.8 billion on April 1, 2020. The Company measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value, which resulted in the recognition of $45.4 billion of Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) spectrum licenses, a portion of which relates to lease agreements (the \u201cAgreements\u201d) with various educational and non-profit institutions that provide the Company with the right to use FCC spectrum licenses (Educational Broadband Services or \u201cEBS spectrum\u201d) in the 2.5 GHz band. Management applied judgment in determining the Agreements enhance the overall value of the Company's owned spectrum licenses as the collective value is higher than the value of individual bands of spectrum within a specific geography. This enhanced value from combining owned and leased spectrum licenses is referred to as an aggregation premium, which is a component of the overall fair value of FCC spectrum licenses, which are recognized as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Management also applied judgment in estimating the overall value of the Spectrum License portfolio using the income approach, specifically a Greenfield model, which involved the use of key assumptions with respect to the discount rate, market share, estimated capital and operating expenditures, forecasted service revenue and long-term growth rate for a hypothetical market participant that enters the wireless industry and builds a nationwide wireless network. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting and valuation of the acquired Spectrum License portfolio in the acquisition of Sprint Corporation is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the accounting for the leased EBS spectrum arrangements, as well as estimating the fair value of the acquired Spectrum License portfolio; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s accounting for the leased EBS spectrum portion of the portfolio as well as evaluating management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the discount rate, market share, estimated capital and operating expenditures, forecasted service revenue and long-term growth rate used in estimating the fair value of the acquired Spectrum License portfolio; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the accounting for the leased EBS spectrum arrangements and estimating the fair value of the acquired Spectrum License portfolio. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement and Spectrum License lease agreements; (ii) evaluating management\u2019s assessment related to the accounting for the leased EBS spectrum arrangements; and (iii) testing \n\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nmanagement\u2019s process for estimating the fair value of the acquired Spectrum License portfolio. Testing management\u2019s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodology, and evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the discount rate, market share, estimated capital and operating expenditures, forecasted service revenue and long-term growth rate. Evaluating the significant assumptions included considering (i) the cost of capital of comparable businesses and consistency with other valuations for the discount rate; (ii) industry factors and historical results for market share; (iii) historical results, and industry data for the estimated capital and operating expenditures and forecasted service revenue assumptions; and (iv) industry and market factors for the long-term growth rate. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions. \n\nAcquisition of Sprint Corporation - Accounting for the Acquired Lease-out and Leaseback Arrangement with Crown Castle International Corp. \n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, in the acquisition of Sprint Corporation, the Company measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value, which resulted in the recognition of property and equipment with a fair value of $2.8 billion and tower obligations related to amounts owed to Crown Castle International Corp. (\u201cCCI\u201d) under the leaseback of $1.1 billion. Additionally, $1.7 billion in other long-term liabilities were recognized associated with contract terms that are unfavorable to current market rates, which includes unfavorable terms associated with the fixed-price purchase option in 2037. Prior to the Merger, Sprint entered into a lease-out and leaseback arrangement with Global Signal Inc., a third party that was subsequently acquired by CCI, that conveyed to CCI the exclusive right to manage and operate approximately 6,400 tower sites via prepaid master lease. These agreements were assumed upon the close of the Merger, at which point the remaining term of the lease-out was approximately 17 years with no renewal options. CCI has a fixed-price purchase option for all (but not less than all) of the leased or subleased sites for approximately $2.3 billion, exercisable one year prior to the expiration of the agreement and ending 120 days prior to the expiration of the agreement. The Company leases back a portion of the space at certain tower sites for an initial term of 10 years, followed by optional renewals at customary terms. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for the acquired lease-out and leaseback arrangement with CCI in the acquisition of Sprint Corporation is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the accounting to reflect the acquisition of the tower lease arrangement; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s accounting for and presentation of the owned leased asset and related liabilities and identification of each unit of account within the transaction; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the accounting for acquired lease-out and leaseback arrangement with CCI. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement and Global Signal Inc. lease agreements; (ii) evaluating management\u2019s accounting for and presentation of the owned leased asset and related liabilities; and (iii) evaluating management\u2019s identification of each unit of account within the transaction. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating management\u2019s accounting assessment of the acquired lease-out and leaseback arrangement with CCI. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nFebruary 23, 2021 \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2001. \n\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nT-Mobile US, Inc. \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n\n (in millions, except share and per share amounts) December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,385 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1283699/000128369921000039/tmus-20201231.htm"}, "2019": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business T-Mobile US, Inc.

All of our revenues were earned in, and all of our long-lived assets are located in, the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We provide mobile communications services primarily using our 4G Long-Term Evolution (\u201cLTE\u201d) network and our newly deployed 5G technology network. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including handsets, tablets and other mobile communication devices, and accessories for sale, as well as financing through Equipment Installment Plans (\u201cEIP\u201d) and leasing through JUMP! On Demand\u2122. Additionally, we provide reinsurance for handset insurance policies and extended warranty contracts offered to our mobile communications customers. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the balances and results of operations of T-Mobile and our consolidated subsidiaries. We consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, as well as variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and VIEs, which cannot be deconsolidated, such as those related to Tower obligations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. We operate as a single operating segment. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. See \u201cAccounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Current Year\u201d below. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts currently due from customers, other carriers and third-party retail channels. Accounts receivable not held for sale are reported in the balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs and the allowance for credit losses. Accounts receivable held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. We have an arrangement to sell the majority of service accounts receivable on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. We offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and certain other purchases in installments typically over a period of 24, but up to 36, months using an EIP. EIP receivables not held for sale are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, allowance for credit losses and unamortized discounts. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest if the EIP term exceeds 12 months as there is no stated rate of interest on the EIP receivables. The EIP receivables are recorded at their present value, which is determined by discounting future cash payments at the imputed interest rate. The difference between the recorded amount of the EIP receivables and their unpaid principal balance (i.e., the contractual amount due from the customer) results in a discount which is allocated to the performance obligations in the arrangement and recorded as a reduction in transaction price in Total service revenues and Equipment revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk on the EIP receivables. As a result, we do not recognize a separate credit loss allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows resulting from credit risk are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. The imputed discount on EIP receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross EIP receivable balances exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances. Total imputed discount and allowances were approximately 7.0% and 8.1% of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including EIP receivables, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The current portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables, net and the long-term portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have an arrangement to sell certain EIP receivables on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. We maintain an allowance for credit losses and determine its appropriateness through an established process that assesses the losses inherent in our receivables portfolio. We develop and document our allowance methodology at the portfolio segment level - accounts receivable portfolio and EIP receivable portfolio segments. While we attribute portions of the allowance to our respective accounts receivable and EIP portfolio segments, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total receivables portfolio. Our process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique risk characteristics of our accounts receivable and EIP receivable portfolio segments. For each portfolio segment, losses are estimated collectively for groups of receivables with similar characteristics. Our allowance levels are influenced by receivable volumes, receivable delinquency status, historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as macro-economic conditions. Inventories Inventories consist primarily of wireless devices and accessories, which are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using standard cost which approximates average cost. Shipping and handling costs paid to wireless device and accessories vendors, and costs to refurbish used devices recovered through our device upgrade programs are included in the standard cost of inventory. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We record inventory write-downs to net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving items based on inventory turnover trends and historical experience. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets include assets that do not have indefinite lives, such as property and equipment and other intangible assets. All of our long-lived assets are located in the U.S., including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indicators of impairment are present, we test recoverability. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the asset or asset group\u2019s carrying amount, then an impairment loss is recorded, measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of buildings and equipment, wireless communications systems, leasehold improvements, capitalized software, leased wireless devices and construction in progress. Buildings and equipment include certain network server equipment. Wireless communications systems include assets to operate our wireless network and IT data centers, including tower assets and leasehold improvements and assets related to the liability for the retirement of long-lived assets. Leasehold improvements include asset improvements other than those related to the wireless network. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments, if any, in Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book value is depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease term. JUMP! On Demand allows customers to lease a device over a period of up to 18 months and upgrade it for a new device up to one time per month. To date, all of our leased devices were classified as operating leases. At operating lease inception, leased wireless devices are transferred from inventory to property and equipment. Leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to us, which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected losses. Revenues associated with the leased wireless devices, net of incentives, are generally recognized over the lease term. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. Returned devices transferred from Property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value with any write-down recognized as Cost of equipment sales in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Costs of major replacements and improvements are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures which do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Construction costs, labor and overhead incurred in the expansion or enhancement of our wireless network are capitalized. Capitalization commences with pre-construction period administrative and technical activities, which includes obtaining leases, zoning approvals and building permits, and ceases at the point at which the asset is ready for its intended use. We capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of certain property and equipment. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated over the useful life of the related assets. We record an asset retirement obligation for the fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, we recognize changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. Our obligations relate primarily to certain legal obligations to remediate leased property on which our network infrastructure and administrative assets are located. We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or acquiring internal use software. Capitalization of software costs commences once the final selection of the specific software solution has been made and management authorizes and commits to funding the software project. Capitalized software costs are included in Property and equipment, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets that do not have indefinite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Customer lists are amortized using the sum-of-the-years'-digits method over the expected period in which the relationship is expected to contribute to future cash flows. The remaining finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is allocated to our two reporting units, wireless and Layer3. Spectrum Licenses Spectrum licenses are carried at costs incurred to acquire the spectrum licenses and the costs to prepare the spectrum licenses for their intended use, such as costs to clear acquired spectrum licenses. The Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) issues spectrum licenses which provide us with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum within specific geographic service areas to provide wireless communications services. While spectrum licenses are issued for a fixed period of time, typically for up to fifteen years, the FCC has granted license renewals routinely and at a nominal cost. The spectrum licenses held by us expire at various dates. We believe we will be able to meet all requirements necessary to secure renewal of our spectrum licenses at nominal costs. Moreover, we determined there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our spectrum licenses. Therefore, we determined the spectrum licenses should be treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets. At times, we enter into agreements to sell or exchange spectrum licenses. Upon entering into the arrangement, if the transaction has been deemed to have commercial substance, spectrum licenses are reviewed for impairment and transferred at their carrying value, net of any impairment, to assets held for sale included in Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until approval and completion of the exchange or sale. Upon closing of the transaction, spectrum licenses acquired as part of an exchange of nonmonetary assets are valued at fair value and the difference between the fair value of the spectrum licenses obtained, book value of the spectrum licenses transferred and cash paid, if any, is recognized as a gain and included in Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Our fair value estimates of spectrum licenses are based on information for which there is little or no observable market data. If the transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value is not measurable, the acquired spectrum licenses are recorded at the book value of the assets transferred or exchanged. Impairment We assess the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired. When assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the two reporting units, wireless and Layer3, is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We test our spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. If the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. We estimate fair value using the Greenfield methodology, which is an income approach based on discounted cash flows associated with the intangible asset, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Guarantee Liabilities We offer a device trade-in program, Just Upgrade My Phone (\u201cJUMP!\u201d), which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. Upon enrollment, participating customers must finance the purchase of a device on an EIP and have a qualifying T-Mobile monthly wireless service plan, which is treated as an arrangement with multiple performance obligations when entered into at or near the same time. Upon a qualifying JUMP! program upgrade, the customer\u2019s remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade-in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new EIP. For customers who enroll in JUMP!, we recognize a liability and reduce revenue for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which requires judgment, including estimating the customer's remaining EIP balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and the probability and timing of trade-in. When customers upgrade their device, the difference between the EIP balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. All assumptions are reviewed periodically. Fair Value Measurements We carry certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs based on the observability as of the measurement date, is as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; and Level 3 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities being measured within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts receivable from affiliates and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying values of EIP receivables approximate fair value as the receivables are recorded at their present value, net of unamortized discount and allowance for credit losses. There were no financial instruments with a carrying value materially different from their fair value, based on quoted market prices or rates for the same or similar instruments, or internal valuation models. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges associated with forecasted debt issuances, changes in fair value are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until reclassified into Interest expense in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, generally over the life of the related debt. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as liabilities. Revenue Recognition (effective January 1, 2018) We primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless services to customers and selling or leasing devices and accessories. Our contracts with customers may involve multiple performance obligations, which include wireless services, wireless devices or a combination thereof, and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Significant Judgments The most significant judgments affecting the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with our customers include the following items: \u2022 Revenue for service contracts that we assess are not probable of collection is not recognized until the contract is completed or terminated and cash is received. Collectibility is re-assessed when there is a significant change in facts or circumstances. Our assessment of collectibility considers whether we may limit our exposure to credit risk through our right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent as well as certain contract terms such as down payments that reduce our exposure to credit risk. Customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. See \u201cReceivables and Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d, above, for more discussion on how we assess credit risk. \u2022 Promotional EIP bill credits offered to a customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether a substantive penalty is deemed to exist. Determining whether contingent EIP bill credits result in a substantive termination penalty may require significant judgment. \u2022 The identification of distinct performance obligations within our service plans may require significant judgment. \u2022 Revenue is recorded net of costs paid to another party for performance obligations where we arrange for the other party to transfer goods or services to the customer (i.e., when we are acting as an agent). For example, performance obligations relating to services provided by third-party content providers where we neither control a right to the content provider\u2019s service nor control the underlying service itself are presented net because we are acting as an agent. The determination of whether we control the underlying service or right to the service prior to our transfer to the customer requires, at times, significant judgment. \u2022 For transactions where we recognize a significant financing component, judgment is required to determine the discount rate. For EIP sales, the discount rate used to adjust the transaction price primarily reflects current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk of the customer. Customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. See \u201cReceivables and Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d, above, for more discussion on how we assess credit risk. \u2022 Our products are generally sold with a right of return, which is accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Device return levels are estimated based on the expected value method as there are a large number of contracts with similar characteristics and the outcome of each contract is independent of the others. Historical return rate experience is a significant input to our expected value methodology. \u2022 Sales of equipment to indirect dealers who have been identified as our customer (referred to as the sell-in model) often include credits subsequently paid to the dealer as a reimbursement for any discount promotions offered to the end consumer. These credits (payments to a customer) are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize from the sales of equipment to indirect dealers and are estimated based on historical experience and other factors, such as expected promotional activity. \u2022 The determination of the standalone selling price for contracts that involve more than one performance obligation may require significant judgment, such as when the selling price of a good or service is not readily observable. \u2022 For capitalized contract costs, determining the amortization period over which such costs are recognized as well as assessing the indicators of impairment may require significant judgment. Wireless Services Revenue We generate our wireless services revenues from providing access to, and usage of, our wireless communications network. Service revenues also include revenues earned for providing value added services to customers, such as handset insurance services. Service contracts are billed monthly either in advance or arrears, or are prepaid. Generally, service revenue is recognized as we satisfy our performance obligation to transfer service to our customers. We typically satisfy our stand-ready performance obligations, including unlimited wireless services, evenly over the contract term. For usage-based and prepaid wireless services, we satisfy our performance obligations when services are rendered. Consideration payable to a customer is treated as a reduction of the total transaction price, unless the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service, such as certain commissions paid to dealers. Federal Universal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d) and other fees are assessed by various governmental authorities in connection with the services we provide to our customers and are included in Cost of services. When we separately bill and collect these regulatory fees from customers, they are recorded gross in Total service revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded approximately $93 million, $161 million and $258 million, respectively, of USF fees on a gross basis. We have made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by us from a customer (e.g., sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes). Equipment Revenues We generate equipment revenues from the sale or lease of mobile communication devices and accessories. For performance obligations related to equipment contracts, we typically transfer control at a point in time when the device or accessory is delivered to, and accepted by, the customer or dealer. We have elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related good transfers as fulfillment activities instead of assessing such activities as performance obligations. We estimate variable consideration (e.g., device returns or certain payments to indirect dealers) primarily based on historical experience. Equipment sales not probable of collection are generally recorded as payments are received. Our assessment of collectibility considers contract terms such as down payments that reduce our exposure to credit risk. We offer certain customers the option to pay for devices and accessories in installments using an EIP. Generally, we recognize as a reduction of the total transaction price the effects of a financing component in contracts where customers purchase their devices and accessories on an EIP with a term of more than one year, including those financing components that are not considered to be significant to the contract. However, we have elected the practical expedient to not recognize the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where we expect, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of a performance obligation to a customer and the customer\u2019s payment for that performance obligation will be one year or less. In addition, for customers who enroll in our JUMP! program, we recognize a liability based on the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The fair value of the guarantee is deducted from the transaction price and the remaining transaction price is allocated to other elements of the contract, including service and equipment performance obligations. See \u201cGuarantee Liabilities\u201d above for further information. JUMP! On Demand allows customers to lease a device over a period of up to 18 months and upgrade it for a new device up to one time per month. To date, all of our leased wireless devices are accounted for as operating leases and estimated contract consideration is allocated between lease elements and non-lease elements (such as service and equipment performance obligations) based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation in the contract. Lease revenues are recorded as equipment revenues and recognized as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease revenues on contracts not probable of collection are limited to the amount of payments received. See \u201cProperty and Equipment\u201d above for further information. Contract Balances Generally, our devices and service plans are available at standard prices, which are maintained on price lists and published on our website and/or within our retail stores. For contracts that involve more than one product or service that are identified as separate performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling price is the price at which we would sell the good or service separately to a customer and is most commonly evidenced by the price at which we sell that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. A contract asset is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of our right to receive consideration (i.e., we must perform additional services in order to receive consideration). Amounts are recorded as receivables when our right to consideration is unconditional. When consideration is received, or we have an unconditional right to consideration in advance of delivery of goods or services, a contract liability is recorded. The transaction price can include non-refundable upfront fees, which are allocated to the identifiable performance obligations. Contract assets are included in Other current assets and Other assets and contract liabilities are included in Deferred revenue in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract Modifications Our service contracts allow customers to frequently modify their contracts without incurring penalties in many cases. Each time a contract is modified, we evaluate the change in scope or price of the contract to determine if the modification should be treated as a separate contract, as if there is a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract, or if the modification should be considered a change associated with the existing contract. We typically do not have significant impacts from contract modifications. Contract Co"]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["Note 16 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments We have commitments for non-dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms that generally extend through 2035. In addition, we have commitments to purchase and lease spectrum licenses, wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business, with various terms through 2043. These amounts are not reflective of our entire anticipated purchases under the related agreements but are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually obligated. Our purchase commitments are approximately $3.6 billion for the year ending December 31, 2020, $3.3 billion in total for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2022, $1.6 billion in total for the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2024 and $1.4 billion in total for the years thereafter. In 2018, we signed a reciprocal long-term spectrum lease with Sprint. The lease includes an offsetting amount to be received from Sprint for the lease of our spectrum. Lease payments began in the fourth quarter of 2018. The minimum commitment under this lease as of December 31, 2019, is $481 million and is included in the purchase obligations above. The reciprocal long-term lease is a distinct transaction from the Merger. Under the previous lease standard certain of our network backhaul arrangements were accounted for as operating leases. Obligations under these agreements were included within our operating lease commitments as of December 31, 2018. These agreements no longer qualify as leases under the new lease standard. Our commitments under these agreements as of December 31, 2019, were approximately $164 million for the year ending December 31, 2020, $267 million in total for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, $171 million in total for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, and $196 million in total for years thereafter. The commitments under these agreements are included in the purchase commitments above. Interest rate lock derivatives We have entered into interest rate lock derivatives with notional amounts of $9.6 billion. These interest rate lock derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges to reduce variability in cash flows due to changes in interest payments attributable to increases or decreases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. The fair value of interest rate lock derivatives as of December 31, 2019, was a liability of $1.2 billion and is included in Other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 7 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements for further information. Renewable Energy Purchase Agreements In April 2019, T-Mobile USA entered into a Renewable Energy Purchase Agreement (\u201cREPA\u201d) with a third party that is based on the expected operation of a solar photovoltaic electrical generation facility located in Texas and will remain in effect until the fifteenth anniversary of the facility\u2019s entry into commercial operation. Commercial operation of the facility is expected to occur in July 2021. The REPA consists of an energy forward agreement that is net settled based on energy prices and the energy output generated by the facility. We have determined that the REPA does not meet the definition of a derivative because the expected energy output of the facility may not be reliably estimated (the arrangement lacks a notional amount). The REPA does not contain any unconditional purchase obligations because amounts under the agreement are not fixed and determinable. Our participation in the REPA did not require an upfront investment or capital commitment. We do not control the activities that most significantly impact the energy-generating facility, nor do we direct the use of, or receive specific energy output from, the facility. Contingencies and Litigation Litigation Matters On June 11, 2019, a number of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit against us, DT, Sprint, and SoftBank in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that the Merger, if consummated, would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act and so should be enjoined. The trial concluded after two weeks of witness testimony and presentation of document evidence. We are now waiting for the trial court\u2019s ruling. See Note 2 \u2013 Business Combinations for further information. In addition to the litigation associated with the Transactions discussed above, we are involved in various lawsuits and disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings (\u201cLitigation Matters\u201d) that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include claims of patent infringement (most of which are asserted by non-practicing entities primarily seeking monetary damages), class actions, and proceedings to enforce FCC rules and regulations. The Litigation Matters described above have progressed to various stages and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing or other adjudication that could result in fines, penalties, or awards of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. We have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate, which is reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements but that is not considered to be, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where we have not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we have not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including but not limited to uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators, uncertain damage theories and demands, and a less than fully developed factual record. While we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, an unfavorable outcome of some or all of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future."]}, "Debt": {"Debt": ["Note 8 \u2013 Debt Debt was as follows: (in millions) December 31, December 31, 5.300% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2021 $ 2,000 $ 2,000 4.000% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2022 1,000 1,000 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022 500 500 Incremental term loan facility to affiliates due 2022 2,000 2,000 6.000% Senior Notes due 2023 1,300 1,300 9.332% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2023 \u2014 600 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024 1,000 1,000 6.500% Senior Notes due 2024 1,000 1,000 6.000% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2024 1,350 1,350 6.000% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2024 650 650 Incremental term loan facility to affiliates due 2024 2,000 2,000 5.125% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2025 1,250 1,250 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 500 500 6.375% Senior Notes due 2025 1,700 1,700 6.500% Senior Notes due 2026 2,000 2,000 4.500% Senior Notes due 2026 1,000 1,000 4.500% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2026 1,000 1,000 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 500 500 5.375% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2027 1,250 1,250 4.750% Senior Notes due 2028 1,500 1,500 4.750% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2028 1,500 1,500 Capital leases (1) \u2014 2,015 Unamortized premium on debt to affiliates 43 52 Unamortized discount on Senior Notes to affiliates (53) (64) Financing arrangements for property and equipment 25 \u2014 Debt issuance costs and consent fees (46) (56) Total debt 24,969 27,547 Less: Current portion of capital leases \u2014 841 Less: Financing arrangements for property and equipment 25 \u2014 Total long-term debt $ 24,944 $ 26,706 Classified on the balance sheet as: Long-term debt $ 10,958 $ 12,124 Long-term debt to affiliates 13,986 14,582 Total long-term debt $ 24,944 $ 26,706 (1) Capital lease liabilities previously included in Short-term debt and Long-term debt were reclassified to Financing lease liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The redemption premium was included in Other expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and in Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Incremental Term Loan Facility In March 2018, we amended the terms of our secured term loan facility (\u201cIncremental Term Loan Facility\u201d) with DT, our majority stockholder. Following this amendment, the applicable margin payable on LIBOR indexed loans is 1.50% under the $2.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility maturing on November 9, 2022 and 1.75% under the $2.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility maturing on January 31, 2024. The amendment also modified the Incremental Term Loan Facility to update certain covenants and other provisions to make them substantially consistent, subject to certain additional carve outs, with our most recently issued public notes. No issuance fees were incurred related to this debt facility for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Commitment Letter In connection with the entry into the Business Combination Agreement, T-Mobile USA entered into a commitment letter, dated as of April 29, 2018 (as amended and restated on May 15, 2018 and on September 6, 2019, the \u201cCommitment Letter\u201d), with certain financial institutions named therein that have committed to provide up to $30.0 billion in secured and unsecured debt financing, including a $4.0 billion secured revolving credit facility, a $7.0 billion secured term loan facility, and a $19.0 billion secured bridge loan facility. On September 6, 2019, T-Mobile USA amended and restated the Commitment Letter which (i) reduced the commitments under the secured term loan facility from $7.0 billion to $4.0 billion and (ii) extended the commitments thereunder through May 1, 2020. The funding of the debt facilities provided for in the Commitment Letter is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth therein, including consummation of the Merger. The proceeds of the debt financing provided for in the Commitment Letter will be used to refinance certain existing debt of us, Sprint and our and Sprint\u2019s respective subsidiaries and for post-closing working capital needs of the combined company. In connection with the financing provided for in the Commitment Letter, we expect to incur certain fees payable to the financial institutions, including certain financing fees on the secured term loan commitment. If the Merger closes, we will incur additional fees for the financial institutions structuring and providing the commitments and certain take-out fees associated with the issuance of permanent secured bond debt in lieu of the secured bridge loan. In total, we may incur up to approximately $340 million in fees associated with the Commitment Letter. We began incurring certain Commitment Letter fees on November 1, 2019, which were recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. There were $12 million of fees accrued as of December 31, 2019. Financing Matters Agreement Pursuant to the Financing Matters Agreement, DT agreed, among other things, to consent to the incurrence by T-Mobile USA of secured debt in connection with and after the consummation of the Merger, and to provide a lock up on sales thereby as to certain senior notes of T-Mobile USA held thereby. In addition, T-Mobile USA agreed, among other things, to repay and terminate, upon closing of the Merger, the Incremental Term Loan Facility and the revolving credit facility of T-Mobile USA which are provided by DT, as well as $2.0 billion of T-Mobile USA\u2019s 5.300% Senior Notes due 2021 and $2.0 billion of T-Mobile USA\u2019s 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024. In addition, T-Mobile USA and DT agreed, upon closing of the Merger, to amend the $1.25 billion of T-Mobile USA\u2019s 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 and $1.25 billion of T-Mobile USA\u2019s 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 to change the maturity dates thereof to April 15, 2021 and April 15, 2022, respectively (the \u201c2025 and 2027 Amendments\u201d). In connection with receiving the requisite consents, we made upfront payments to DT of $7 million during the second quarter of 2018. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt to affiliates in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In accordance with the consents received from DT, on December 20, 2018, T-Mobile USA, the guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, executed and delivered the 38 th supplemental indenture to the Indenture, pursuant to which, with respect to certain T-Mobile USA Senior Notes held by DT, the Proposed Amendments (as defined below under \u201cConsents on Debt to Third Parties\u201d) and the 2025 and 2027 Amendments will become effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. If the Merger is consummated, we will make additional payments for requisite consents to DT of $13 million. There were no additional payments accrued as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Consents on Debt to Third Parties On May 18, 2018, under the terms and conditions described in the Consent Solicitation Statement, we obtained consents necessary to effect certain amendments to our Senior Notes to third parties in connection with the Business Combination Agreement. Pursuant to the Consent Solicitation Statement, third-party note holders agreed, among other things, to consent to increasing the amount of Secured Indebtedness under Credit Facilities that can be incurred from the greater of $9.0 billion and 150% of Consolidated Cash Flow to the greater of $9.0 billion and an amount that would not cause the Secured Debt to Cash Flow Ratio (calculated net of cash and cash equivalents) to exceed 2.00x (the \u201cRatio Secured Debt Proposed Amendments\u201d) and in each case as such capitalized term is defined in the Indenture. In connection with receiving the requisite consents for the Ratio Secured Debt Proposed Amendments, we made upfront payments to third-party note holders of $17 million during the second quarter of 2018. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These upfront payments increased the effective interest rate of the related debt. In addition, note holders agreed, among other things, to allow certain entities related to Sprint\u2019s existing spectrum securitization notes program (\u201cExisting Sprint Spectrum Program\u201d) to be non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, provided that the principal amount of the spectrum notes issued and outstanding under the Existing Sprint Spectrum Program does not exceed $7.0 billion and that the principal amount of such spectrum notes reduces the amount available under the Credit Facilities ratio basket, and to revise the definition of GAAP to mean generally accepted accounting principles in effect from time to time, unless the Company elects to \u201cfreeze\u201d GAAP as of any date, and to exclude the effect of the changes in the accounting treatment of lease obligations (the \u201cExisting Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Proposed Amendments,\u201d and together with the Ratio Secured Debt Proposed Amendments, the \u201cProposed Amendments\u201d). In connection with receiving the requisite consents for the Existing Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Proposed Amendments, we made upfront payments to third-party note holders of $14 million during the second quarter of 2018. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These upfront payments increased the effective interest rate of the related debt. In connection with obtaining the requisite consents, on May 20, 2018, T-Mobile USA, the guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, executed and delivered the 37 th supplemental indenture to the Indenture, pursuant to which, with respect to each of the Notes, the Proposed Amendments will become effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. We paid third-party bank fees associated with obtaining the requisite consents related to the Proposed Amendments of $6 million during the second quarter of 2018, which we recognized as Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. If the Merger is consummated, we will make additional payments to third-party note holders for requisite consents related to the Ratio Secured Debt Proposed Amendments of up to $54 million and additional payments to third-party note holders for requisite consents related to the Existing Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Proposed Amendments of up to $41 million. There were no payments accrued as of December 31, 2019. Financing Arrangements We maintain a financing arrangement with Deutsche Bank AG, which allows for up to $108 million in borrowings. Under the financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain vendors. The interest rate on the financing arrangement is determined based on LIBOR plus a specified margin per the arrangement. Obligations under the financing arrangement are included in Short-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no outstanding balances. We maintain vendor financing arrangements with our primary network equipment suppliers. Under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we utilized $800 million and repaid $775 million under the vendor financing arrangements. Invoices subject to extended payment terms have various due dates through the first quarter of 2020. Payments on vendor financing agreements are included in Repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2019, there was $25 million in outstanding borrowings under the vendor financing agreements which were included in Short-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2018, there was no outstanding balance. Revolving Credit Facility We maintain a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with DT which is comprised of a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement and a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit agreement. In December 2019, we amended the terms of the revolving credit facility with DT to extend the maturity date to December 29, 2022. The proceeds and borrowings from the revolving credit facility are presented in Proceeds from borrowing on revolving credit facility and Repayments of revolving credit facility within Net cash used in financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Standby Letters of Credit For the purposes of securing our obligations to provide handset insurance services, we maintain an agreement for standby letters of credit with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cJP Morgan Chase\u201d). For purposes of securing our general purpose obligations, we maintain a letter of credit reimbursement agreement with Deutsche Bank. The following table summarizes the outstanding standby letters of credit under each agreement: (in millions) December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 JP Morgan Chase $ 20 $ 20 Deutsche Bank 93 66 Total outstanding balance $ 113 $ 86 "]}, "external_audit": "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of T-Mobile US, Inc. \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, of stockholders\u2019 equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nChanges in Accounting Principles \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues in 2018. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \n\nT a b l e o f C o n t e n t s \n\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nAdoption of Leases Standard \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has adopted the new accounting standard on Leases, on January 1, 2019, by recognizing and measuring leases at the adoption date with a cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application. As a result, among other adjustments, the Company recognized operating lease right-of-use assets of $9,251 million and operating lease liabilities of $11,364 million on the balance sheet on the date of adoption. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying amounts of operating and finance lease right-of-use assets were $10,933 million and $2,715 million respectively and operating and finance lease liabilities were $12,826 million and $2,303 million respectively. The Company recorded $3,406 million of lease expense during the year. Management also reassessed the previously failed sale-leasebacks of certain T-Mobile-owned wireless communication tower sites to determine whether the transfer of the assets to the tower operator under the arrangement met the transfer of control criteria in the revenue standard and whether a sale should be recognized. This reassessment resulted in (i) assets relating to 6,200 tower sites transferred pursuant to a master prepaid lease arrangement continuing to be accounted for as failed sale-leasebacks; (ii) a sale being recognized for 1,400 tower sites sold that were not associated with the master prepaid lease. Upon adoption, the Company derecognized its existing long-term financial obligation and the tower-related property and equipment associated with these 1,400 previously failed sale-leaseback tower sites and recognized a lease liability and right-of-use asset for the leaseback of the tower sites. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the adoption of the lease standard is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment by management in applying the lease standard to a large volume of leases in the company\u2019s lease portfolio; (ii) implementation of new lease accounting systems resulted in material changes to the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting; and (iii) significant judgment in the application of the standard relating to sale-leaseback accounting. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the implementation of new lease accounting systems and management\u2019s significant judgments, including the assessment of the previously failed sale-leaseback tower sites. The audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from the procedures. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the adoption of the new standard on the Company\u2019s various lease portfolios, including those associated with previously failed sale-leaseback transactions and testing of controls over the implementation and functionality of the new lease accounting systems. The procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of management\u2019s identification of the leases in the Company\u2019s lease portfolios and evaluating the reasonableness of significant judgments made by management to identify contractual terms in lease arrangements that impact the determination of the right-of-use asset and lease liability amount recognized. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist with the evaluation of previous failed sales-leaseback tower sites. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nFebruary 6, 2020 \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2001. \n\nT a b l e o f C o n t e n t s \n\nT-Mobile US, Inc. \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n\n (in millions, except share and per share amounts) December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,528 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1283699/000128369920000026/tmus-20191231.htm"}, "2018": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business T-Mobile US, Inc. (\u201cT-Mobile,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a leading provider of mobile communications services, including voice, messaging and data, under its flagship brands, T-Mobile and Metro\u2122 by T-Mobile (\u201cMetro by T-Mobile\u201d), in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d), Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. All of our revenues were earned in, and all of our long-lived assets are located in, the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We provide mobile communications services primarily using 4G Long-Term Evolution (\u201cLTE\u201d) technology. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including handsets, tablets and other mobile communication devices, and accessories for sale, as well as financing through Equipment Installment Plans (\u201cEIP\u201d) and leasing through JUMP! On Demand\u2122. Additionally, we provide reinsurance for handset insurance policies and extended warranty contracts offered to our mobile communications customers. Basis of Presentation The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. Examples include service revenues earned but not yet billed, service revenues billed but not yet earned, relative standalone selling prices, allowances for credit losses and sales returns, discounts for imputed interest on EIP receivables, guarantee liabilities, losses incurred but not yet reported, tax liabilities, deferred income taxes including valuation allowances, useful lives of long-lived assets, fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations, residual values on leased handsets, reasonably assured renewal terms for operating leases, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, and fair value measurements, including those related to goodwill, spectrum licenses, intangible assets, beneficial interests in factoring and securitization transactions and derivative financial instruments. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from these estimates. We operate as a single operating segment. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year\u2019s presentation. See \u201cAccounting Pronouncements Adopted in the Current Year\u201d below. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts currently due from customers, other carriers and third-party retail channels. Accounts receivable not held for sale are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs and the allowance for credit losses. Accounts receivable held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. We have an arrangement to sell the majority of service accounts receivable on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. We offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments over a period of up to 36 months using an EIP. EIP receivables not held for sale are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, allowance for credit losses and unamortized discounts. Receivables held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest if the EIP term exceeds 12 months as there is no stated rate of interest on the EIP receivables. The EIP receivables are recorded at their present value, which is determined by discounting future cash payments at the imputed interest rate. The difference between the recorded amount of the EIP receivables and their unpaid principal balance (i.e., the contractual amount due from the customer) results in a discount which is allocated to the performance obligation of the arrangement and recorded as a reduction in transaction price in Total service revenues and Equipment revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . We determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk on the EIP receivables. As a result, we do not recognize a separate credit loss allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows resulting from credit risk are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. The imputed discount on EIP receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross EIP receivable balances exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances. Total imputed discount and allowances was approximately 8.1% of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including EIP receivables at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. The current portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables, net and the long-term portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . We have an arrangement to sell certain EIP receivables on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. We maintain an allowance for credit losses and determine its appropriateness through an established process that assesses the losses inherent in our receivables portfolio. We develop and document our allowance methodology at the portfolio segment level - accounts receivable portfolio and EIP receivable portfolio segments. While we attribute portions of the allowance to our respective accounts receivable and EIP portfolio segments, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total receivables portfolio. Our process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique risk characteristics of our accounts receivable and EIP receivable portfolio segments. For each portfolio segment, losses are estimated collectively for groups of receivables with similar characteristics. Our allowance levels are influenced by receivable volumes, receivable delinquency status, historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as macro-economic conditions. Inventories Inventories consist primarily of wireless devices and accessories, which are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using standard cost which approximates average cost. Shipping and handling costs paid to wireless device and accessories vendors, and costs to refurbish used devices recovered through our device upgrade programs are included in the standard cost of inventory. We record inventory write-downs to net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving items based on inventory turnover trends and historical experience. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets include assets that do not have indefinite lives, such as property and equipment and other intangible assets. All of our long-lived assets are located in the U.S., including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indicators of impairment are present, we test recoverability. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the asset or asset group\u2019s carrying amount, then an impairment loss is recorded, measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of buildings and equipment, wireless communication systems, leasehold improvements, capitalized software, leased wireless devices and construction in progress. Buildings and equipment include certain network server equipment. Wireless communication systems include assets to operate our wireless network and IT data centers, including tower assets and leasehold improvements, assets related to the liability for the retirement of long-lived assets and capital leases. Leasehold improvements include asset improvements other than those related to the wireless network. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments, if any, in Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets . We generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book value is depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease term. JUMP! On Demand allows customers to lease a device over a period of up to 18 months and upgrade it for a new device up to one time per month. To date, all of our leased devices were classified as operating leases. At operating lease inception, leased wireless devices are transferred from inventory to property and equipment. Leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to us, which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected losses. Revenues associated with the leased wireless devices, net of incentives, are generally recognized over the lease term. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. Returned devices transferred from Property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as Cost of equipment sales in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Costs of major replacements and improvements are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures which do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Construction costs, labor and overhead incurred in the expansion or enhancement of our wireless network are capitalized. Capitalization commences with pre-construction period administrative and technical activities, which includes obtaining leases, zoning approvals and building permits, and ceases at the point at which the asset is ready for its intended use. We capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of certain property and equipment. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated over the useful life of the related assets. Future obligations related to capital leases are included in Short-term debt and Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . Depreciation of assets held under capital leases is included in Depreciation and amortization expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . We record an asset retirement obligation for the fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, we recognize changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. Our obligations relate primarily to certain legal obligations to remediate leased property on which our network infrastructure and administrative assets are located. We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or acquiring internal use software. Capitalization of software costs commences once the final selection of the specific software solution has been made and management authorizes and commits to funding the software project. Capitalized software costs are included in Property and equipment, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets that do not have indefinite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Customer lists are amortized using the sum-of-the-years-digits method over the expected period in which the relationship is expected to contribute to future cash flows. The remaining finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Spectrum Licenses Spectrum licenses are carried at costs incurred to acquire the spectrum licenses and the costs to prepare the spectrum licenses for their intended use, such as costs to clear acquired spectrum licenses. The Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) issues spectrum licenses which provide us with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum within specific geographic service areas to provide wireless communication services. While spectrum licenses are issued for a fixed period of time, typically for up to fifteen years , the FCC has granted license renewals routinely and at a nominal cost. The spectrum licenses held by us expire at various dates. We believe we will be able to meet all requirements necessary to secure renewal of our spectrum licenses at nominal costs. Moreover, we determined there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our spectrum licenses. Therefore, we determined the spectrum licenses should be treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets. At times, we enter into agreements to sell or exchange spectrum licenses. Upon entering into the arrangement, if the transaction has been deemed to have commercial substance, spectrum licenses are reviewed for impairment and transferred at their carrying value, net of any impairment, to assets held for sale included in Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until approval and completion of the exchange or sale. Upon closing of the transaction, spectrum licenses acquired as part of an exchange of nonmonetary assets are valued at fair value and the difference between the fair value of the spectrum licenses obtained, book value of the spectrum licenses transferred and cash paid, if any, is recognized as a gain and included in Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Our fair value estimates of spectrum licenses are based on information for which there is little or no observable market data. If the transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value is not measurable, the acquired spectrum licenses are recorded at the book value of the assets transferred or exchanged. Impairment We assess the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired. When assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the two reporting units, wireless business and Layer3 TV, is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We test our spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. If the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. We estimate fair value using the Greenfield methodology, which is an income approach, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Guarantee Liabilities We offer a device trade-in program, Just Upgrade My Phone (\u201cJUMP!\u201d), which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. Upon enrollment, participating customers must finance the purchase of a device on an EIP and have a qualifying T-Mobile monthly wireless service plan, which is treated as a single multiple-element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time. Upon a qualifying JUMP! program upgrade, the customer\u2019s remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade-in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new EIP. For customers who enroll in JUMP!, we recognize a liability and reduce revenue for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which requires judgment, including estimating the customer's remaining EIP balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and the probability and timing of trade-in. When customers upgrade their device, the difference between the EIP balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. All assumptions are reviewed periodically. Fair Value Measurements We carry certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs based on the observability as of the measurement date, is as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; and Level 3 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities being measured within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts receivable from affiliates and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying values of EIP receivables approximate fair value as the receivables are recorded at their present value, net of unamortized discount and allowance for credit losses. There were no financial instruments with a carrying value materially different from their fair value, based on quoted market prices or rates for the same or similar instruments, or internal valuation models. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) until reclassified into Interest expense in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, generally over the life of the related debt. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as liabilities. We have embedded derivatives for certain components of the reset feature of the Senior Reset Notes to affiliates, which are required to be bifurcated and are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in Interest expense to affiliates in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Revenue Recognition (effective January 1, 2018) We primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless services to customers and selling or leasing devices and accessories. Our contracts with customers may involve multiple performance obligations, which include wireless services, wireless devices or a combination thereof, and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Significant Judgments The most significant judgments affecting the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with our customers include the following items: \u2022 Revenue for service contracts that we assess are not probable of collection is not recognized until the contract is completed and cash is received. Collectibility is re-assessed when there is a significant change in facts or circumstances. Our assessment of collectibility considers whether we may limit our exposure to credit risk through our right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent as well as certain contract terms such as down payments that reduce our exposure to credit risk. Customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. See \u201cReceivables and Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d, above, for more discussion on how we assess credit risk. \u2022 Promotional EIP bill credits offered to a customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether a substantive penalty is deemed to exist. Determining whether contingent EIP bill credits result in a substantive termination penalty may require significant judgment. \u2022 The identification of distinct performance obligations within our service plans may require significant judgment. \u2022 Revenue is recorded net of costs paid to another party for performance obligations where we arrange for the other party to transfer goods or services to the customer (i.e., when we are acting as an agent). For example, performance obligations relating to services provided by third-party content providers where we neither controls a right to the content provider\u2019s service nor controls the underlying service itself are presented net because we are acting as an agent. The determination of whether we control the underlying service or right to the service prior to our transfer to the customer requires, at times, significant judgment. \u2022 For transactions where we recognize a significant financing component, judgment is required to determine the discount rate. For EIP sales, the discount rate used to adjust the transaction price primarily reflects current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk of the customer. Customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. See \u201cReceivables and Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d, above, for more discussion on how we assess credit risk. \u2022 Our products are generally sold with a right of return, which is accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Device return levels are estimated based on the expected value method as there are a large number of contracts with similar characteristics and the outcome of each contract is independent of the others. Historical return rate experience is a significant input to our expected value methodology. \u2022 Sales of equipment to indirect dealers who have been identified as our customer (referred to as the sell-in model) often include credits subsequently paid to the dealer as a reimbursement for any discount promotions offered to the end consumer. These credits (payments to a customer) are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize from the sales of equipment to indirect dealers and are estimated based on historical experience and other factors, such as expected promotional activity. \u2022 The determination of the standalone selling price for contracts that involve more than one performance obligation may require significant judgment, such as when the selling price of a good or service is not readily observable. \u2022 For capitalized contract costs, determining the amortization period over which such costs are recognized as well as assessing the indicators of impairment may require significant judgment. Wireless Services Revenue We generate our wireless services revenues from providing access to, and usage of, our wireless communications network. Service revenues also include revenues earned for providing value added services to customers, such as handset insurance services. Service contracts are billed monthly either in advance or arrears, or are prepaid. Generally, service revenue is recognized as we satisfy our performance obligation to transfer service to our customers. We typically satisfy our stand-ready performance obligations, including unlimited wireless services, evenly over the contract term. For usage-based and prepaid wireless services, we satisfy our performance obligations when services are rendered. Revenue for service contracts that we assess are not probable of collection is not recognized until the contract is completed and cash is received. Collectibility is re-assessed when there is a significant change in facts or circumstances. Our assessment of collectibility considers whether we may limit our exposure to credit risk through our right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent. Consideration payable to a customer is treated as a reduction of the total transaction price, unless the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service, such as certain commissions paid to dealers. Revenue is recorded net of costs paid to another party for performance obligations where we arrange for the other party to transfer goods or services to the customer (i.e., when we are acting as an agent). For example, performance obligations relating to services provided by third-party content providers where we neither controls a right to the content provider\u2019s service nor controls the underlying service itself are presented net because we are acting as an agent. Federal Universal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d) and other regulatory fees are assessed by various governmental authorities in connection with the services we provide to our customers and are included in Cost of services. When we separately bill and collect these regulatory fees from customers, they are recorded gross in Total service revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded approximately $161 million , $258 million and $409 million , respectively, of USF fees on a gross basis. We have made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by us from a customer (for example, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes). Equipment Revenues We generate equipment revenues from the sale or lease of mobile communication devices and accessories. For performance obligations related to equipment contracts, we typically transfer control at a point in time when the device or accessory is delivered to, and accepted by, the customer or dealer. We have elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related good transfers as fulfillment activities instead of assessing such activities as performance obligations. We estimate variable consideration (e.g., device returns or certain payments to indirect dealers) primarily based on historical experience. Equipment sales not probable of collection are generally recorded as payments are received. Our assessment of collectibility considers contract terms such as down payments that reduce our exposure to credit risk. We offer certain customers the option to pay for devices and accessories in installments using an EIP. Generally, we recognize as a reduction of the total transaction price the effects of a financing component in contracts where customers purchase their devices and accessories on an EIP with a term of more than one year, including those financing components that are not considered to be significant to the contract. However, we have elected the practical expedient to not recognize the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where we expect, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of a performance obligation to a customer and the customer\u2019s payment for that performance obligation will be one year or less. In addition, for customers who enroll in our JUMP! program, we recognize a liability based on the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The fair value of the guarantee is deducted from the transaction price and the remaining transaction price is allocated to other elements of the contract, including service and equipment performance obligations. See \u201cGuarantee Liabilities\u201d above for further information. JUMP! On Demand allows customers to lease a device over a period of up to 18 months and upgrade it for a new device up to one time per month. To date, all of our leased wireless devices are accounted for as operating leases and estimated contract consideration is allocated between lease elements and non-lease elements (such as service and equipment performance obligations) based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation in the contract. Lease revenues are recorded as equipment revenues and recognized as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease revenues on contracts not probable of collection are limited to the amount of payments received. See \u201cProperty and Equipment\u201d above for further information. Contract Balances Generally, our devices and service plans are available at standard prices, which are maintained on price lists and published on our website and/or within our retail stores. For contracts that involve more than one product or service that are identified as separate performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The"]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["Note 15 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies Commitments Operating Leases We have non-cancellable operating leases for cell sites, switch sites, retail stores and office facilities with contractual terms expiring through 2028 . The majority of cell site leases have an initial non-cancelable term of five to ten years with several renewal options. In addition, we have operating leases for dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms through 2027 . Our commitments under these leases are approximately $2.7 billion for the year ending December 31, 2019 , $4.7 billion in total for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2021 , $3.3 billion in total for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2023 and $3.8 billion in total for years thereafter. As of December 31, 2018 , we were contingently liable for future ground lease payments related to the tower obligations. These contingent obligations are not included in the above table as the amounts due are contractually owed by CCI based on the subleasing arrangement. See Note 9 \u2013 Tower Obligations for further information. Total rent expense under operating leases, including dedicated transportation lines, was $3.0 billion , $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and is classified as Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Purchase Commitments We have commitments for non-dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms through 2029 . In addition, we have commitments to purchase and lease spectrum licenses, wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business, with various terms through 2043 . These amounts are not reflective of our entire anticipated purchases under the related agreements but are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually obligated. Our purchase obligations are approximately $3.4 billion for the year ending December 31, 2019 , $2.8 billion in total for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2021 , $1.8 billion in total for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2023 and $1.4 billion in total for the years thereafter. In June 2018, we entered into an agreement for the purchase of network equipment totaling approximately $3.5 billion . Based on unavoidable spend, the minimum commitment under this agreement is $377 million as of December 31, 2018 . In September 2018, we amended an agreement with a third party to increase the total amount of network equipment to purchase by approximately $3.5 billion . Based on unavoidable spend, the minimum commitment under this agreement is $259 million as of December 31, 2018 . In September 2018, we signed a reciprocal long-term spectrum lease with Sprint that included a total commitment of $535 million and an offsetting amount to be received from Sprint for the lease of our spectrum. Lease payments began in the fourth quarter of 2018. The reciprocal long-term lease is a distinct transaction from the Merger. In October 2018, we entered into agreements with a third-party associated with a device upgrade program, trade-in services, and device protection products and services offered to our mobile communications customers, with initial terms of one to three years . Device protection products and services include reinsurance for device insurance policies and extended warranty contracts, mobile security applications, and technical support services. Interest rate lock derivatives In October 2018, we entered into interest rate lock derivatives with notional amounts of $9.6 billion These interest rate lock derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges to reduce variability in cash flows due to changes in interest payments attributable to increases or decreases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. The fair value of interest rate lock derivatives as of December 31, 2018 was $447 million and is included in Other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . See Note 7 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements for further information. Renewable Energy Purchase Agreements During 2018, T-Mobile USA entered four renewable energy purchase agreements (\u201cREPAs\u201d) with third parties. The REPAs are based on the expected operation of energy-generating facilities and will remain in effect for terms of between 15 and 20 years from the commencement of facility\u2019s entry into commercial operation. Commercial operations are set to begin at the end of 2019 or 2020. Each REPA consists of an energy forward agreement that is net settled based on energy prices and the energy output generated by the facility. We have determined that each of the REPAs does not meet the definition of a derivative because the expected energy output of the facility may not be reliably estimated (the arrangement lacks a notional amount). The REPAs do not contain any unconditional purchase obligations because amounts under the agreement are not fixed and determinable. Our participations in the REPAs did not require upfront investments or capital commitments. We do not control the activities that most significantly impact the energy-generating facilities, nor do we receive specific energy output from them. Contingencies and Litigation Litigation Matters We are involved in various lawsuits and disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings (\u201cLitigation Matters\u201d) that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include claims of patent infringement (most of which are asserted by non-practicing entities primarily seeking monetary damages), class actions, and proceedings to enforce FCC rules and regulations. The Litigation Matters described above have progressed to various stages and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing or other adjudication that could result in fines, penalties, or awards of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. We have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate, which is reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements but that we do not consider, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where we have not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we have not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including but not limited to uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators, uncertain damage theories and demands, and a less than fully developed factual record. While we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, an unfavorable outcome of some or all of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future."]}, "Debt": {"Debt": ["Note 8 \u2013 Debt Debt was as follows: (in millions) December 31, December 31, 8.097% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2021 $ \u2014 $ 1,250 5.300% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2021 2,000 2,000 8.195% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2022 \u2014 1,250 4.000% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2022 1,000 1,000 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022 500 500 6.125% Senior Notes due 2022 \u2014 1,000 Incremental term loan facility to affiliates due 2022 2,000 2,000 6.000% Senior Notes due 2023 1,300 1,300 6.625% Senior Notes due 2023 \u2014 1,750 6.836% Senior Notes due 2023 \u2014 600 9.332% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2023 600 600 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024 1,000 1,000 6.500% Senior Notes due 2024 1,000 1,000 6.000% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2024 1,350 1,350 6.000% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2024 650 650 Incremental term loan facility to affiliates due 2024 2,000 2,000 5.125% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2025 1,250 1,250 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 500 500 6.375% Senior Notes due 2025 1,700 1,700 6.500% Senior Notes due 2026 2,000 2,000 4.500% Senior Notes due 2026 1,000 \u2014 4.500% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2026 1,000 \u2014 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 500 500 5.375% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2027 1,250 1,250 4.750% Senior Notes due 2028 1,500 \u2014 4.750% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2028 1,500 \u2014 Capital leases 2,015 1,824 Unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment \u2014 78 Unamortized premium on debt to affiliates 52 59 Unamortized discount on Senior Notes to affiliates (64 ) (73 ) Debt issuance costs and consent fees (56 ) (19 ) Total debt 27,547 28,319 Less: Current portion of Senior Notes \u2014 999 Less: Current portion of capital leases 841 613 Total long-term debt $ 26,706 $ 26,707 Classified on the balance sheet as: Long-term debt $ 12,124 $ 12,121 Long-term debt to affiliates 14,582 14,586 Total long-term debt $ 26,706 $ 26,707 Debt to Third Parties During the year ended December 31, 2018 we issued the following Senior Notes: (in millions) Principal Issuances Issuance Costs Net Proceeds from Issuance of Long-Term Debt Issue Date 4.500% Senior Notes due 2026 $ 1,000 $ 2 $ 998 January 25, 2018 4.750% Senior Notes due 2028 1,500 4 1,496 January 25, 2018 Total of Senior Notes issued $ 2,500 $ 6 $ 2,494 We used the net proceeds of $2.494 billion from the public debt issuance to redeem our $1.750 billion of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2023 on April 1, 2018, and to redeem our $600 million of 6.836% Senior Notes due 2023 on April 28, 2018, and for general corporate purposes, including the partial repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility with DT.

(2) Cash for the premium portion of the redemption price set forth in the indenture governing the DT Senior Reset Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest on the DT Senior Reset Notes to, but not including, the exchange date. Incremental Term Loan Facility In March 2018, we amended the terms of our secured term loan facility (\u201cIncremental Term Loan Facility\u201d) with DT, our majority stockholder. Following this amendment, the applicable margin payable on LIBOR indexed loans is 1.50% under the $2.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility maturing on November 9, 2022 and 1.75% under the $2.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility maturing on January 31, 2024. The amendment also modified the Incremental Term Loan Facility to (i) include a soft-call prepayment premium of 1.00% of the outstanding principal amount of the loans under the Incremental Term Loan Facility payable to DT upon certain refinancings of such loans by us with lower priced debt prior to a date that is six months after March 29, 2018 and (ii) update certain covenants and other provisions to make them substantially consistent, subject to certain additional carve outs, with our most recently issued public notes. No issuance fees were incurred related to this debt facility for the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017 . Commitment Letter Under the Commitment Letter in connection with the Merger, certain financial institutions named therein have committed to provide up to $30.0 billion in secured and unsecured debt financing, including a $4.0 billion secured revolving credit facility, a $7.0 billion secured term loan facility and a $19.0 billion secured bridge loan facility. In connection with the financing provided for in the Commitment Letter, we expect to incur certain fees if the Merger closes, including fees for the financial institutions structuring and providing the commitments for the secured term loan facility, secured revolving loan facility and the secured bridge loan, and certain take-out fees associated with the issuance of permanent secured bond debt in lieu of the secured bridge loan. We expect to incur up to approximately $340 million if the closing date occurs on or after April 29, 2019. There was no fee accrued as of December 31, 2018 . We also may be required to draw down on the $7.0 billion secured term loan facility on May 1, 2019, and would be required to place the proceeds in escrow and pay interest thereon until the Merger closes. Financing Matters Agreement Pursuant to the Financing Matters Agreement, DT agreed, among other things, to consent to the incurrence by T-Mobile USA of secured debt in connection with and after the consummation of the Merger, and to provide a lock up on sales thereby as to certain senior notes of T-Mobile USA held thereby. In addition, T-Mobile USA agreed, among other things, to repay and terminate, upon closing of the Merger, the Incremental Term Loan Facility and the revolving credit facility of T-Mobile USA which are provided by DT, as well as $2.0 billion of T-Mobile USA\u2019s 5.300% Senior Notes due 2021 and $2.0 billion of T-Mobile USA\u2019s 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024. In addition, T-Mobile USA and DT agreed, upon closing of the Merger, to amend the $1.25 billion of T-Mobile USA\u2019s 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 and $1.25 billion of T-Mobile USA\u2019s 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 to change the maturity dates thereof to April 15, 2021 and April 15, 2022, respectively (the \u201c2025 and 2027 Amendments\u201d). In connection with receiving the requisite consents, we made upfront payments to DT of $7 million during the second quarter of 2018. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt to affiliates in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In accordance with the consents received from DT, on December 20, 2018, T-Mobile USA, the guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, executed and delivered the 38 th supplemental indenture to the Indenture, pursuant to which, with respect to certain T-Mobile USA Senior Notes held by DT, the Proposed Amendments (as defined below under \u201cConsents on Debt to Third Parties\u201d) and the 2025 and 2027 Amendments will become effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. If the Merger is consummated, we will make additional payments for requisite consents to DT of $20 million . There was no additional payment accrued as of December 31, 2018 . Consents on Debt to Third Parties On May 18, 2018, under the terms and conditions described in the Consent Solicitation Statement, we obtained consents necessary to effect certain amendments to our Senior Notes to third parties in connection with the Business Combination Agreement. Pursuant to the Consent Solicitation Statement, third-party note holders agreed, among other things, to consent to increasing the amount of Secured Indebtedness under Credit Facilities that can be incurred from the greater of $9.0 billion and 150% of Consolidated Cash Flow to the greater of $9.0 billion and an amount that would not cause the Secured Debt to Cash Flow Ratio (calculated net of cash and cash equivalents) to exceed 2.00x (the \u201cRatio Secured Debt Proposed Amendments\u201d) and in each case as such capitalized term is defined in the Indenture. In connection with receiving the requisite consents for the Ratio Secured Debt Proposed Amendments, we made upfront payments to third-party note holders of $17 million during the second quarter of 2018. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These upfront payments increased the effective interest rate of the related debt. In addition, note holders agreed, among other things, to allow certain entities related to Sprint\u2019s existing spectrum securitization notes program (\u201cExisting Sprint Spectrum Program\u201d) to be non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, provided that the principal amount of the spectrum notes issued and outstanding under the Existing Sprint Spectrum Program does not exceed $7.0 billion and that the principal amount of such spectrum notes reduces the amount available under the Credit Facilities ratio basket, and to revise the definition of GAAP to mean generally accepted accounting principles in effect from time to time, unless the Company elects to \u201cfreeze\u201d GAAP as of any date, and to exclude the effect of the changes in the accounting treatment of lease obligations (the \u201cExisting Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Proposed Amendments,\u201d and together with the Ratio Secured Debt Proposed Amendments, the \u201cProposed Amendments\u201d). In connection with receiving the requisite consents for the Existing Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Proposed Amendments, we made upfront payments to third-party note holders of $14 million during the second quarter of 2018. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These upfront payments increased the effective interest rate of the related debt. In connection with obtaining the requisite consents, on May 20, 2018, T-Mobile USA, the guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, executed and delivered the 37 th supplemental indenture to the Indenture, pursuant to which, with respect to each of the Notes, the Proposed Amendments will become effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. We paid third-party bank fees associated with obtaining the requisite consents related to the Proposed Amendments of $6 million during the second quarter of 2018, which we recognized as Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. If the Merger is consummated, we will make additional payments to third-party note holders for requisite consents related to the Ratio Secured Debt Proposed Amendments of up to $54 million and additional payments to third-party note holders for requisite consents related to the Existing Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Proposed Amendments of up to $41 million . There was no payment accrued as of December 31, 2018 . Financing Arrangements We maintain a handset financing arrangement with Deutsche Bank AG (\u201cDeutsche Bank\u201d), which allows for up to $108 million in borrowings. Under the handset financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain handset vendors. The interest rate on the handset financing arrangement is determined based on LIBOR plus a specified margin per the arrangement. Obligations under the handset financing arrangement are included in Short-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . In 2017 , we utilized and repaid $100 million under the financing arrangement. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , there was no outstanding balance. We maintain vendor financing arrangements with our primary network equipment suppliers. Under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. The interest rate on the vendor financing arrangements is determined based on the difference between LIBOR and a specified margin per the agreements. Obligations under the vendor financing arrangements are included in Short-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . In 2018 , we utilized and repaid $300 million under the financing arrangement. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , there was no outstanding balance. Revolving Credit Facility We have a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with DT that is comprised of (i) a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement (\u201cUnsecured Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and (ii) a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit agreement (\u201cSecured Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). In January 2018, we utilized proceeds under our revolving credit facility with DT to redeem $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% Senior Notes due 2022 and for general corporate purposes. On January 29, 2018, the proceeds utilized under our revolving credit facility with DT were repaid. In March 2018, we amended the terms of our Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and our Secured Revolving Credit Facility. Following these amendments, (i) the range of the applicable margin payable under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility is 2.05% to 3.05% , (ii) the range of applicable margin payable under the Secured Revolving Credit Facility is 1.05% to 1.80% , (iii) the range of the undrawn commitment fee applicable to the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility is 0.20% to 0.575% , (iv) the range of the undrawn commitment fee applicable to the Secured Revolving Credit Facility is 0.25% to 0.45% , and (v) the maturity date of the revolving credit facility with DT is December 29, 2020. The amendments also modify the facility to update certain covenants and other provisions to make them substantially consistent, subject to certain additional carve outs, with our most recently issued public notes. In November 2018, we amended the terms of the revolving credit facility with DT to extend the maturity date to December 29, 2021. The proceeds and borrowings from the revolving credit facility are presented in Proceeds from borrowing on revolving credit facility and Repayments of revolving credit facility within Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Capital Leases Capital lease agreements primarily relate to network equipment with varying expiration terms through 2033 . Future minimum payments required under capital leases, including interest and maintenance, over their remaining terms are summarized below: (in millions) Future Minimum Payments Year Ended December 31, 2019 $ 909 2020 631 2021 389 2022 102 2023 66 Thereafter 106 Total $ 2,203 Included in Total Interest $ 143 Maintenance 45 Standby Letters of Credit For the purposes of securing our obligations to provide handset insurance services, we maintain an agreement for standby letters of credit with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework   (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated   financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of   their   operations and their   cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018   in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework   (2013)   issued by the COSO. \n\nChange in Accounting Principle \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for revenues and the manner in which it accounts for cash receipts and cash payments in 2018. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated   financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated   financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated   financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated   financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated   financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated   financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with \n\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nFebruary 6, 2019   \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2001. \n\nT-Mobile US, Inc. \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets   \n\n (in millions, except share and per share amounts) \n\nDecember 31, 2018 \n\n\u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1283699/000128369919000015/tmus12312018form10-k.htm"}, "2017": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business T-Mobile US, Inc. (\u201cT-Mobile,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a leading provider of mobile communications services, including voice, messaging and data, under its flagship brands, T-Mobile and MetroPCS, in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d), Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We provide mobile communications services primarily using 4G Long-Term Evolution (\u201cLTE\u201d) technology. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including handsets, tablets and other mobile communication devices, and accessories for sale, as well as financing through Equipment Installment Plans (\u201cEIP\u201d) and leasing through JUMP! On Demand\u2122. Additionally, we provide reinsurance for handset insurance policies and extended warranty contracts offered to our mobile communications customers. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the balances and results of operations of T-Mobile and our consolidated subsidiaries. We operate as a single operating segment. We consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, as well as variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and VIEs, which cannot be deconsolidated, such as those related to Tower obligations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified, such as those relating to the imputed discount on EIP receivables reclassified from Interest income to Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income , to conform to the current year\u2019s presentation. See \u201cChange in Accounting Principle\u201d below. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. Examples include service revenues earned but not yet billed, service revenues billed but not yet earned, relative selling prices, allowances for credit losses and sales returns, discounts for imputed interest on EIP receivables, guarantee liabilities, losses incurred but not yet reported, tax liabilities, deferred income taxes including valuation allowances, useful lives of long-lived assets, cost estimates of asset retirement obligations, residual values on leased handsets, reasonably assured renewal terms for operating leases, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, and fair value measurements, including those related to goodwill, spectrum licenses, intangible assets, beneficial interests in factoring and securitization transactions and derivative financial instruments. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts currently due from customers, other carriers and third-party retail channels. Accounts receivable not held for sale are reported in the balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs and the allowance for credit losses. Accounts receivable held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. We have an arrangement to sell the majority of service accounts receivable on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. We offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments over a period of up to 24 months using an EIP. EIP receivables not held for sale are reported in the balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, allowance for credit losses and unamortized discounts. Receivables held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest as there is no stated rate of interest on the EIP receivables and record the EIP receivables at their present value, which is determined by discounting future payments at the imputed interest rate. The difference between the present value of the EIP receivables and their face amount results in a discount which is recorded as a direct reduction to the carrying value with a corresponding reduction to equipment revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . We determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk on the EIP receivables. As a result, we do not recognize a separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. The imputed discount on EIP receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross EIP receivable balances exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances. The current portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables, net and the long-term portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . We have an arrangement to sell certain EIP receivables on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. We maintain an allowance for credit losses and determine its appropriateness through an established process that assesses the losses inherent in our receivables portfolio. We develop and document our allowance methodology at the portfolio segment level - accounts receivable portfolio and EIP receivable portfolio segments. While we attribute portions of the allowance to our respective accounts receivable and EIP portfolio segments, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total receivables portfolio. Our process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique risk characteristics of our accounts receivable and EIP receivable portfolio segments. For each portfolio segment, losses are estimated collectively for groups of receivables with similar characteristics. Our allowance levels are influenced by receivable volumes, receivable delinquency status, historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as macro-economic conditions. Inventories Inventories consist primarily of wireless devices and accessories, which are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using standard cost which approximates average cost. Shipping and handling costs paid to wireless device and accessories vendors, and costs to refurbish used devices recovered through our device upgrade programs are included in the standard cost of inventory. We record inventory write-downs to net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving items based on inventory turnover trends and historical experience. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets include assets that do not have indefinite lives, such as property and equipment and other intangible assets. We assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indicators of impairment are present, we test recoverability. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the asset or asset group\u2019s carrying amount, then an impairment loss is recorded, measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of buildings and equipment, wireless communication systems, leasehold improvements, capitalized software, leased wireless devices and construction in progress. Buildings and equipment include certain network server equipment. Wireless communication systems include assets to operate our wireless network and IT data centers, including tower assets and leasehold improvements, assets related to the liability for the retirement of long-lived assets and capital leases. Leasehold improvements include asset improvements other than those related to the wireless network. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments, if any, in Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets . We generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of useful lives for certain categories of property and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book value is depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease term. We introduced JUMP! On Demand, which allows customers to lease a device over a period of up to 18 months and upgrade it for a new device up to one time per month. To date, all of our leased devices were classified as operating leases. At operating lease inception, leased wireless devices are transferred from inventory to property and equipment. Leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to us, which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected losses. Revenues associated with the leased wireless devices, net of incentives, are generally recognized over the lease term. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. Returned devices transferred from Property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as Cost of equipment sales in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Costs of major replacements and improvements are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures which do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Construction costs, labor and overhead incurred in the expansion or enhancement of our wireless network are capitalized. Capitalization commences with pre-construction period administrative and technical activities, which includes obtaining leases, zoning approvals and building permits, and ceases at the point at which the asset is ready for its intended use. We capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of certain property and equipment. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated over the useful life of the related assets. Future obligations related to capital leases are included in Short-term debt and Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . Depreciation of assets held under capital leases is included in Depreciation and amortization expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . We record an asset retirement obligation for the fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, we recognize changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. Our obligations relate primarily to certain legal obligations to remediate leased property on which our network infrastructure and administrative assets are located. We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or acquiring internal use software. Capitalization of software costs commences once the final selection of the specific software solution has been made and management authorizes and commits to funding the software project. Capitalized software costs are included in Property and equipment, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets that do not have indefinite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Customer lists are amortized using the sum-of-the-years-digits method over the expected period in which the relationship is expected to contribute to future cash flows. The remaining finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Spectrum Licenses Spectrum licenses are carried at costs incurred to acquire the spectrum licenses and the costs to prepare the spectrum licenses for their intended use, such as costs to clear acquired spectrum licenses. The Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) issues spectrum licenses which provide us with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum within specific geographic service areas to provide wireless communication services. While spectrum licenses are issued for a fixed period of time, typically for up to fifteen years, the FCC has granted license renewals routinely and at a nominal cost. The spectrum licenses held by us expire at various dates. We believe we will be able to meet all requirements necessary to secure renewal of our spectrum licenses at nominal costs. Moreover, we determined there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our spectrum licenses. Therefore, we determined the spectrum licenses should be treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets. At times, we enter into agreements to sell or exchange spectrum licenses. Upon entering into the arrangement, if the transaction has been deemed to have commercial substance, spectrum licenses are reviewed for impairment and transferred at their carrying value, net of any impairment, to assets held for sale included in Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until approval and completion of the exchange or sale. Upon closing of the transaction, spectrum licenses acquired as part of an exchange of nonmonetary assets are valued at fair value and the difference between the fair value of the spectrum licenses obtained, book value of the spectrum licenses transferred and cash paid, if any, is recognized as a gain and included in Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Our fair value estimates of spectrum licenses are based on information for which there is little or no observable market data. If the transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value is not measurable, the acquired spectrum licenses are recorded at the book value of the assets transferred or exchanged. Impairment We assess the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired. When assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We test our spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. If the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. We estimate fair value using the Greenfield methodology, which is an income approach, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Guarantee Liabilities We offer a device trade-in program, Just Upgrade My Phone (\u201cJUMP!\u201d), which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. Upon enrollment, participating customers must finance the purchase of a device on an EIP and have a qualifying T-Mobile monthly wireless service plan, which is treated as a single multiple-element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time. Upon a qualifying JUMP! program upgrade, the customer\u2019s remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade-in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new EIP. For customers who enroll in JUMP!, we recognize a liability and reduce revenue for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which requires judgment, including estimating the customer's remaining EIP balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and the probability and timing of trade-in. We assess our guarantee liability at each reporting date to determine if facts and circumstances would indicate the incurrence of an incremental contingent liability is probable and if so, reasonably estimable. The recognition and subsequent adjustments of the contingent guarantee liability as a result of these assessments are recorded as adjustments to revenue. When customers upgrade their device, the difference between the EIP balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. Fair Value Measurements We carry certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs based on the observability as of the measurement date, is as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; and Level 3 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities being measured within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts receivable from affiliates and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying values of EIP receivables approximate fair value as the receivables are recorded at their present value, net of unamortized discount and allowance for credit losses. There were no financial instruments with a carrying value materially different from their fair value, based on quoted market prices or rates for the same or similar instruments, or internal valuation models. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments primarily relate to embedded derivatives for certain components of the reset feature of the Senior Reset Notes to affiliates, which are required to be bifurcated and are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in Interest expense to affiliates in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . We do not enter into derivative positions for trading or speculative purposes. Revenue Recognition We primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless services to customers and selling or leasing devices and accessories. We offer our wireless services and devices to customers, which may be comprised of multiple contracts entered into with a customer at or near the same time. In recognizing revenue, we assess such agreements as a single bundled arrangement that may involve multiple deliverables, which include wireless services, wireless devices or a combination thereof, and allocate revenue between each deliverable based on the relative selling prices of each deliverable on a standalone basis. Wireless Services Revenue We generate our wireless service revenues from providing access to, and usage of, our wireless communications network. Service revenues also include revenues earned for providing value added services to customers, such as handset insurance services. Service revenues are billed either in advance or arrears or are prepaid and are recognized when the service is rendered and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Revenues that are not reasonably assured to be collectible are recorded on a cash basis as payments are received. The recognition of prepaid revenue is deferred until services are rendered or the customer\u2019s rights to service expire unused. Generally, incentives given to customers are recorded as a reduction to revenue. We recognize service revenues for Data Stash plans when such services are delivered and the data is consumed, or at time of forfeiture or expiration. Revenues relating to unused data that is carried over to the following month are deferred and valued based on their relative standalone selling price. Revenue is recorded gross for arrangements involving the resale of third-party services where we are considered the primary obligor and is recorded net of associated costs incurred for services whereby we are not considered the primary obligor. Federal Universal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d) and other fees are assessed by various governmental authorities in connection with the services we provide to our customers. When we separately bill and collect these regulatory fees from customers, they are recorded gross in Total service revenues and cost of services in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we recorded approximately $258 million , $409 million and $334 million , respectively, of USF fees on a gross basis. Equipment Revenues We generate equipment revenues from the sale or lease of mobile communication devices and accessories. Device and accessory sales revenues are generally recognized when the products are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer or dealer. We defer a portion of equipment revenues and cost of equipment sales for expected device returns based on historical experience. We offer certain customers the option to pay for devices and accessories in installments using an EIP. Equipment sales not reasonably assured to be collectible are recorded on a cash basis as payments are received. In addition, for customers enrolled in JUMP!, we separate the JUMP! trade-in right from the multiple element arrangement at its fair value and defer the portion of revenue which represents the fair value of the trade-in right. See Guarantee Liabilities section above for further information. We introduced JUMP! On Demand, which allows customers to lease a device and upgrade their leased wireless device for a new device up to one time per month. Leased wireless devices are accounted for as operating leases and lease revenues are recognized as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The residual value of purchased leased devices is recorded as equipment revenues and cost of equipment sales. See Property and Equipment section above for further information. Rent Expense We have operating leases for cell sites, retail locations, corporate offices and dedicated transportation lines, some of which have escalating rentals during the initial lease term and during subsequent optional renewal periods. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis, over the non-cancelable lease term and renewal periods that are considered reasonably assured at the inception of the lease. We consider several factors in assessing whether renewal periods are reasonably assured of being exercised, including the continued maturation of our network nationwide, technological advances within the telecommunications industry and the availability of alternative sites. Advertising Expense We expense the cost of advertising and other promotional expenditures to market our services and products as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , advertising expenses included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income were $1.8 billion , $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion , respectively. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available. We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of adjustments, net of tax, related to unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities. This is reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity until realized in earnings. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and performance-based restricted stock units (\u201cPRSUs\u201d), is measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of expected forfeitures, over the related service period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. RSUs are recognized as expense using the straight-line method. PRSUs are recognized as expense following a graded vesting schedule. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing Net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of outstanding stock options, RSUs and PRSUs, calculated using the treasury stock method, and prior to the conversion of our preferred stock, potentially dilutive common shares included mandatory convertible preferred stock calculated using the if-converted method. See Note 12 - Earnings Per Share for further information. Our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program during the fourth quarter of 2017. Repurchased shares are retired and reduce the number of shares issued and outstanding. See Note 10 - Repurchases of Common Stock for further information. Variable Interest Entities VIEs are entities which lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, have equity investors which do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations through voting rights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most common type of VIE is a special purpose entity (\u201cSPE\u201d). SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE's assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party which has both the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE which could potentially be significant to the VIE. We consolidate VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary or when the VIE cannot be deconsolidated. In assessing which party is the primary beneficiary, all the facts and circumstances are considered, including each party\u2019s role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers and servicers) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. Change in Accounting Principle Effective January 1, 2017, the imputed discount on EIP receivables, which is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method, and was previously presented within Interest income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income , is now presented within Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . We believe this presentation is preferable because it provides a better representation of amounts earned from our major ongoing operations and aligns with industry practice thereby enhancing comparability. We have applied this change retrospectively and prese"]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["Note 13 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies Commitments Operating Leases We have non-cancellable operating leases for cell sites, switch sites, retail stores and office facilities with contractual terms expiring through 2027 . The majority of cell site leases have an initial non-cancelable term of five to ten years with several renewal options. In addition, we have operating leases for dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms through 2024 . Our commitments under these leases are approximately $2.4 billion in 2018 , $4.1 billion in total for 2019 and 2020 , $2.7 billion in total for 2021 and 2022 and $2.3 billion in total for years thereafter. As of December 31, 2017 , we were contingently liable for future ground lease payments related to the tower obligations. These contingent obligations are not included in the above table as the amounts due are contractually owed by CCI based on the subleasing arrangement. See Note 8 \u2013 Tower Obligations for further information. Total rent expense under operating leases, including dedicated transportation lines, was $2.9 billion , $2.8 billion and $2.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and is classified as Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . In February 2018, we extended the leases related to our corporate headquarters facility. These agreements will increase our minimum lease payments by approximately $400 million in the aggregate. Purchase Commitments We have commitments for non-dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms through 2028 . In addition, we have commitments to purchase spectrum licenses, wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business, with various terms through 2028 . These amounts are not reflective of our entire anticipated purchases under the related agreements, but are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually obligated. We have contractual obligations to purchase certain goods and services from various other parties. Our purchase obligations are approximately $2.1 billion in 2018 , $2.2 billion in total for 2019 and 2020 , $1.5 billion in total for 2021 and 2022 and $1.0 billion in total for years thereafter. In September 2017, we entered into a UPA to acquire the remaining equity in IWS, a 54% owned unconsolidated subsidiary, for a purchase price of $25 million . In January 2018, we closed on the purchase agreement and received the IWS spectrum licenses, among other assets. See Note 5 - Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets for further information. On January 22, 2018, we completed our acquisition of television innovator Layer3 TV for consideration of approximately $325 million , subject to customary working capital and other post-closing adjustments. Upon closing of the transaction, Layer3 TV became a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary. This transaction represents an opportunity for us to acquire a unique and complementary service and represents a progression in our video strategy, which began with Binge On, was strengthened with Netflix On Us, and will expand further with Layer3 TV\u2019s management, technology, and content relationships which will enable us to bring the Un-carrier philosophy to video. Our first-quarter 2018 operating results will include the results of Layer3 TV from the date of acquisition. Our consolidated balance sheet will include the assets and liabilities of Layer3 TV, such as intangibles assets acquired, which are being appraised by a third-party and include various assumptions in determining fair value. Renewable Energy Purchase Agreements In January 2017, T-Mobile USA entered into a REPA with Red Dirt Wind Project, LLC. The agreement is based on the expected operation of a wind energy-generating facility located in Oklahoma and will remain in effect until the twelfth anniversary of the facility\u2019s entry into commercial operation. The facility began commercial operations in January 2018. The REPA consists of two components: (1) an energy forward agreement that is net settled based on energy prices and the energy output generated by the facility and (2) a commitment to purchase the renewable energy credits (\u201cRECs\u201d) associated with the energy output generated by the facility. T-Mobile USA will net settle the forward agreement and acquire the RECs monthly by paying, or receiving, an aggregate net payment based on two variables (1) the facility\u2019s energy output, which has an estimated maximum capacity of approximately 160 megawatts and (2) the difference between (a) an initial fixed price, subject to annual escalation, and (b) current local marginal energy prices during the monthly settlement period. We have determined that the REPA does not meet the definition of a derivative because the expected energy output of the facility may not be reliably estimated (the arrangement lacks a notional amount). The REPA does not contain any unconditional purchase obligations because amounts under the agreement are not fixed and determinable. Our participation in the REPA did not require an upfront investment or capital commitment. We do not control the activities that most significantly impact the energy-generating facility nor do we receive specific energy output from it. No amounts were settled under the agreement during the year ended December 31, 2017 . In August 2017, T-Mobile USA entered into a REPA with Solomon Forks Wind Project, LLC. The agreement is based on the expected operation of a wind energy-generating facility located in Kansas and will remain in effect until the fifteenth anniversary of the facility\u2019s entry into commercial operation. Commercial operation of the facility is expected to occur by the end of 2018. The REPA consists of two components: (1) an energy forward agreement that is net settled based on energy prices and the energy output generated by the facility and (2) a commitment to purchase the environmental attributes (\u201cEACs\u201d) associated with the energy output generated by the facility. T-Mobile USA will net settle the forward agreement and acquire the EACs monthly by paying, or receiving, an aggregate net payment based on two variables (1) the facility\u2019s energy output, which has an estimated maximum capacity of approximately 160 megawatts and (2) the difference between (a) an initial fixed price, subject to annual escalation, and (b) current local marginal energy prices during the monthly settlement period. We have determined that the REPA does not meet the definition of a derivative because the expected energy output of the facility may not be reliably estimated (the arrangement lacks a notional amount). The REPA does not contain any unconditional purchase obligations because amounts under the agreement are not fixed and determinable. Our participation in the REPA did not require an upfront investment or capital commitment. We do not control the activities that most significantly impact the energy-generating facility nor do we receive specific energy output from it. No amounts were settled under the agreement during the year ended December 31, 2017 . Contingencies and Litigation We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings (\u201cLitigation Matters\u201d) that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include claims of patent infringement (most of which are asserted by non-practicing entities primarily seeking monetary damages), class actions, and proceedings to enforce FCC rules and regulations. The Litigation Matters described above have progressed to various stages and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing or other adjudication that could result in fines, penalties, or awards of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months, if they are not otherwise resolved. We have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate, which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements but that we do not consider, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where we have not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we have not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including but not limited to: uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; uncertain damage theories and demands; and a less than fully developed factual record.

(2) Our Senior Secured Term Loan extinguished during the year ended December 31, 2017 was Third Party debt. On January 25, 2017, T-Mobile USA, Inc. (\u201cT-Mobile USA\u201d), and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into an agreement to borrow $4.0 billion under a secured term loan facility (\u201cIncremental Term Loan Facility\u201d) with DT, our majority stockholder, to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding senior secured term loans under its Term Loan Credit Agreement dated November 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction used to redeem callable high yield debt. The Incremental Term Loan Facility increased DT\u2019s incremental term loan commitment provided to T-Mobile USA under that certain First Incremental Facility Amendment dated as of December 29, 2016, from $660 million to $2.0 billion and provided T-Mobile USA with an additional $2.0 billion incremental term loan commitment. On January 31, 2017, the loans under the Incremental Term Loan Facility were drawn in two tranches: (i) $2.0 billion of which bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% and matures on November 9, 2022, and (ii) $2.0 billion of which bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% and matures on January 31, 2024. In July 2017, we repriced the $2.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility maturing on January 31, 2024, with DT by reducing the interest rate to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% . No issuance fees were incurred related to this debt agreement for the year ended December 31, 2017 . On March 31, 2017, the Incremental Term Loan Facility was amended to waive all interim principal payments. The outstanding principal balance will be due at maturity. During the year ended December 31, 2017 , we issued the following Senior Notes to DT: (in millions) Principal Issuances (Redemptions) Discounts (1) Net Proceeds from Issuance of Long-Term Debt 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022 $ 1,000 $ (23 ) $ 977 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 1,250 (28 ) 1,222 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 (2) 1,250 (28 ) 1,222 6.288% Senior Reset Notes due 2019 (1,250 ) \u2014 (1,250 ) 6.366% Senior Reset Notes due 2020 (1,250 ) \u2014 (1,250 ) Total $ 1,000 $ (79 ) $ 921 (1) Discounts reduce Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and are included within Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . (2) In April 2017, we issued to DT $750 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 , and in September 2017, we issued to DT the remaining $500 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 . On March 13, 2017, DT agreed to purchase a total of $3.5 billion in aggregate principal amounts of Senior Notes with various interest rates and maturity dates (the \u201cnew DT Notes\u201d). Through net settlement in April 2017, we issued to DT a total of $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of the new DT Notes and redeemed the $2.5 billion in outstanding aggregate principal amount of Senior Reset Notes with various interest rates and maturity dates (the \u201cold DT Notes\u201d). The redemption prices of the old DT Notes were 103.144% and 103.183% , resulting in a total of $79 million in early redemption fees. These early redemption fees were recorded as discounts on the issuance of the new DT Notes. In September 2017, we issued to DT $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 , which is the final tranche of the new DT Notes. We were not required to pay any underwriting fees or issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the notes. Net proceeds from the issuance of the new DT Notes were $921 million and are included in Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . On May 9, 2017, we exercised our option under existing purchase agreements and issued the following Senior Notes to DT: (in millions) Principal Issuances Premium Net Proceeds from Issuance of Long-Term Debt 5.300% Senior Notes due 2021 $ 2,000 $ \u2014 $ 2,000 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024 1,350 40 1,390 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024 650 24 674 Total $ 4,000 $ 64 $ 4,064 The proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of spectrum licenses won in the 600 MHz spectrum auction. Net proceeds from these issuances include $64 million in debt premiums. See Note 5 - Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets for further information. On January 22, 2018, DT agreed to purchase $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.500% Senior Notes due 2026 and $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.750% Senior Notes due 2028 directly from T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, with no underwriting discount (the \u201cDT Notes\u201d). DT has agreed that the payment for the DT notes will be made by delivery of $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 8.097% Senior Reset Notes due 2021 and $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 8.195% Senior Reset Notes due 2022 (collectively, the \u201cDT Senior Reset Notes\u201d) held by DT and which T-Mobile USA will have called for redemption, in exchange for the DT notes. In connection with such exchange, we will pay DT in cash the premium portion of the redemption price set forth in the indenture governing the DT Senior Reset Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest on the DT Senior Reset Notes to, but not including, the exchange date. The closing of the issuance and sale of the DT notes to DT, and exchange of the DT Senior Reset Notes, is expected to occur on or about April 30, 2018.

Under the handset financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain handset vendors. The interest rate on the handset financing arrangement is determined based on LIBOR plus a specified margin per the arrangement. Obligations under the handset financing arrangement are included in Short-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . In 2016 , we utilized and repaid $100 million under the financing arrangement. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , there was no outstanding balance. We maintain vendor financing arrangements with our primary network equipment suppliers. Under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. The interest rate on the vendor financing arrangements is determined based on the difference between LIBOR and a specified margin per the agreements. Obligations under the vendor financing arrangements are included in Short-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . In 2017 , we utilized and repaid $300 million under the financing arrangement. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , there was no outstanding balance. Revolving Credit Facility and Standby Letters of Credit We had an unsecured revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom which allowed for up to $500 million in borrowings. In December 2016, we terminated our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom. In December 2016, T-Mobile USA entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom which comprised of (i) a three -year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement and (ii) a three -year $1.5 billion secured revolving credit agreement. The applicable margin for the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility ranges from 2.00% to 3.25% per annum for Eurodollar Rate loans. The applicable margin for the Secured Revolving Credit Facility ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum for Eurodollar Rate loans. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. In January 2018, we utilized proceeds under the revolving credit facility to redeem $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% Senior Notes due 2022 and for general corporate purposes. As of February 5, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework   (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated   financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the results of   their   operations and their   cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017   in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework   (2013)   issued by the COSO. \n\nChange in Accounting Principle \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the presentation of imputed discount on Equipment Installment Plan (\u201cEIP\u201d) receivables. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated   financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated   financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated   financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated   financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated   financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated   financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally \n\naccepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nFebruary 7, 2018   \n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2001. \n\nT-Mobile US, Inc. \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n\n (in millions, except share and per share amounts) \n\nDecember 31, 2017 \n\n\u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1283699/000128369918000011/tmus12312017form10-k.htm"}, "2016": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business T-Mobile US, Inc. (\u201cT-Mobile,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a leading provider of mobile communications services, including voice, messaging and data, under its flagship brands, T-Mobile and MetroPCS, in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d), Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We provide mobile communications services primarily using 4G Long-Term Evolution (\u201cLTE\u201d) technology. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including handsets, tablets and other mobile communication devices, and accessories for sale, as well as financing through Equipment Installment Plans (\u201cEIP\u201d) and leasing through JUMP On Demand\u2122. Additionally, we provide reinsurance for handset insurance policies and extended warranty contracts offered to our mobile communications customers. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the balances and results of operations of T-Mobile and our consolidated subsidiaries. We operate as a single operating segment. We consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, as well as variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and VIEs, which cannot be deconsolidated, such as those related to Tower obligations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts relating to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2015-03, \u201cSimplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. See \u201cAccounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Current Year\u201d below. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. Examples include service revenues earned but not yet billed, service revenues billed but not yet earned, relative selling prices, allowances for uncollectible accounts and sales returns, discounts for imputed interest on EIP receivables, guarantee liabilities, losses incurred but not yet reported, tax liabilities, deferred income taxes including valuation allowances, useful lives of long-lived assets, cost estimates of asset retirement obligations, residual values on leased handsets, reasonably assured renewal terms for operating leases, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, and fair value measurements related to goodwill, spectrum licenses, intangible assets, and derivative financial instruments. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Short-Term Investments Our short-term investments consist of U.S. Treasury securities classified as available for sale, which are stated at fair value and have remaining maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase. Unrealized gains and losses, net of related income taxes, on available for sale securities are reported as net increases and decreases to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d), a component of stockholders' equity, until realized. The estimated fair values of our short-term investments are based on quoted market prices as of the end of the reporting period. The U.S. Treasury securities reported as of December 31, 2015 matured during 2016. We review our available-for-sale securities for impairment on a quarterly basis or more often if a potential loss-triggering event occurs. If there has been a decline in the fair value below the amortized cost basis, we assess whether the impairment is other-than-temporary by considering, among other factors, the reason for the decline in fair value, our intent to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If we determine the impairment is other-than-temporary, we record a charge to Other expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Accounts Receivable and Allowances Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts billed and currently due from customers, other carriers and third-party retail channels (\u201cdealers\u201d), as well as revenues earned but not yet billed at the end of each period. Accounts receivable not held for sale are reported in the balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs and the allowance for credit losses. Accounts receivable held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. We have an arrangement to sell the majority of service accounts receivable on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. We maintain an allowance for estimated losses inherent in the accounts receivable portfolio based on a number of factors, including historical experience and current collection trends, aging of the receivable portfolio, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions. We write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date. Equipment Installment Plan Receivables We offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments over a period of up to 24 months using an EIP. EIP not held for sale are reported in the balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, allowance for credit losses and unamortized discounts. Accounts receivable held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest as there is no stated rate of interest on the EIP receivables and record the EIP receivables at their present value, which is determined by discounting future payments at the imputed interest rate. The difference between the present value of the EIP receivables and their face amount results in a discount which is recorded as a direct reduction to the carrying value with a corresponding reduction to equipment revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . We determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the amount of expected credit losses on the EIP receivables. As a result, we do not recognize a separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. The imputed discount on EIP receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as Interest income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross EIP receivable balances exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances. The allowance is based on a number of factors, including collection experience, aging of the EIP receivable portfolio, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions. We write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date. Equipment sales not reasonably assured to be collectible are recorded on a cash basis as payments are received. The current portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables, net and the long-term portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . We have an arrangement to sell certain EIP receivables on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. Inventories Inventories consist primarily of wireless devices and accessories, which are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using standard cost which approximates average cost. Shipping and handling costs paid to wireless device and accessories vendors, and costs to refurbish used devices recovered through our device upgrade programs are included in the standard cost of inventory. We record inventory write-downs to net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving items based on inventory turnover trends and historical experience. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets include assets that do not have indefinite lives, such as property and equipment and other intangible assets. We assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indicators of impairment are present, we test recoverability. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the asset or asset group\u2019s carrying amount, then an impairment loss is recorded, measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of buildings and equipment, wireless communication systems, leasehold improvements, capitalized software, leased wireless devices and construction in progress. Buildings and equipment include certain network server equipment. Wireless communication systems include assets to operate our wireless network and IT data centers, including tower assets and leasehold improvements, assets related to the liability for the retirement of long-lived assets and capital leases. Leasehold improvements include asset improvements other than those related to the wireless network. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments, if any, in Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets . We generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of useful lives for certain categories of property and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book value is depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease term. In 2015, we introduced JUMP! On Demand which allows customers to lease a device over a period up to 18 months and upgrade it for a new one up to three times in a 12 month period. To date, all of our leased devices were classified as operating leases by considering critical elements of the lease arrangement such as the lease term and the economic life, fair value and residual value of the device. At operating lease inception, leased wireless devices are transferred from inventory to property and equipment. Leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to us, which is generally the lease term. Revenues associated with the leased wireless devices, net of incentives, are generally recognized over the lease term. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. Returned devices transferred from Property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as Cost of equipment sales in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Costs of major replacements and improvements are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures which do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Construction costs, labor and overhead incurred in the expansion or enhancement of our wireless network are capitalized. Capitalization commences with pre-construction period administrative and technical activities, which includes obtaining leases, zoning approvals and building permits, and ceases at the point at which the asset is ready for its intended use. We capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of certain property and equipment. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated over the useful life of the related assets. Future obligations related to capital leases are included in Short-term debt and Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . Depreciation of assets held under capital leases is included in Depreciation and amortization expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . We record an asset retirement obligation for the fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, we recognize changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. Our obligations relate primarily to certain legal obligations to remediate leased property on which our network infrastructure and administrative assets are located. We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or acquiring internal use software. Capitalization of software costs commences once the final selection of the specific software solution has been made and management authorizes and commits to funding the software project. Capitalized software costs are included in Property and equipment, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well as maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred. Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets that do not have indefinite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Customer lists are amortized using the sum-of-the-years-digits method over the expected period in which the relationship is expected to contribute to future cash flows. The remaining finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Spectrum Licenses Spectrum licenses are carried at costs incurred to acquire the spectrum licenses and the costs to prepare the spectrum licenses for their intended use, such as costs to clear acquired spectrum licenses. The Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) issues spectrum licenses which provide us with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum within specific geographic service areas to provide wireless communication services. While spectrum licenses are issued for a fixed period of time, typically for up to fifteen years, the FCC has granted license renewals routinely and at a nominal cost. The spectrum licenses held by us expire at various dates. We believe we will be able to meet all requirements necessary to secure renewal of our spectrum licenses at nominal costs. Moreover, we determined there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our spectrum licenses. Therefore, we determined the spectrum licenses should be treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets. At times, we enter into agreements to sell or exchange spectrum licenses. Upon entering into the arrangement, if the transaction has been deemed to have commercial substance, spectrum licenses are reviewed for impairment and transferred at their carrying value, net of any impairment, to assets held for sale included in Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until approval and completion of the exchange or sale. Upon closing of the transaction, spectrum licenses acquired as part of an exchange of nonmonetary assets are valued at fair value and the difference between the fair value of the spectrum licenses obtained, book value of the spectrum licenses transferred and cash paid, if any, is recognized as a gain and included in Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Our fair value estimates of spectrum licenses are based on information for which there is little or no observable market data. If the transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value is not measurable, the acquired spectrum licenses are recorded at the book value of the assets transferred or exchanged. Impairment We assess the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two-step test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is performed. In the second step, we determine the fair values of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including those that may not be currently recorded. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the fair value of all of those assets and liabilities represents the implied goodwill amount. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. We test our spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset group is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset group is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. If the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. We estimate fair value using the Greenfield approach, which is an income approach, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Guarantee Liabilities We offer a device trade-in program, Just Upgrade My Phone (\u201cJUMP!\u201d), which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. Participating customers must finance the purchase of a device on an EIP and have a qualifying T-Mobile monthly wireless service plan, which is treated as a single multiple-element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time. Upon a qualifying JUMP! program upgrade, the customer\u2019s remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade-in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new EIP. For customers who enroll in JUMP!, we defer and recognize a liability for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which requires judgment, including estimating the customer's remaining EIP balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and the probability and timing of trade-in. We assess our guarantee liability at each reporting date to determine if facts and circumstances would indicate the incurrence of an incremental contingent liability is probable and if so, reasonably estimable. The recognition and subsequent adjustments of the contingent guarantee liability as a result of these assessments are recorded as adjustments to revenue. When customers upgrade their device, the difference between the EIP balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. Fair Value Measurements We carry certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs based on the observability as of the measurement date, is as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; and Level 3 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities being measured within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts receivable from affiliates and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying values of EIP receivables approximate fair value as the receivables are recorded at their present value, net of unamortized discount and allowance for credit losses. There were no financial instruments with a carrying value materially different from their fair value, based on quoted market prices or rates for the same or similar instruments, or internal valuation models. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments primarily relate to embedded derivatives for certain components of the reset feature of the Senior Reset Notes to affiliates, which are required to be bifurcated and are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in Interest expense to affiliates in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . We do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Revenue Recognition We primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless services to customers and selling or leasing devices and accessories. We offer our wireless services and devices to customers through bundled arrangements, which may be comprised of multiple contracts entered into with a customer at or near the same time. In recognizing revenue, we assess such agreements as a single bundled arrangement that may involve multiple deliverables, which include wireless services, wireless devices or a combination thereof, and allocated revenue between each deliverable based on the relative selling prices of each deliverable on a standalone basis. In June 2016, we introduced #GetThanked, which offers eligible customers the following free promotional items as part of their T-Mobile service: \u2022 T-Mobile stock - A share of T-Mobile stock to eligible new (through December 31, 2016) or existing (as of June 6, 2016) customers. Shares issued to customers under this promotion are purchased by an independent third-party broker in the open market on behalf of eligible customers. The associated cost, which is paid by T-Mobile, is recorded as a reduction of service revenue for existing customers and as a reduction of equipment revenue for new customers in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Through December 31, 2016, existing eligible customers can also receive a share of T-Mobile stock (subject to a maximum of 100 shares in a calendar year) for every new active account they refer, purchased by the third-party broker and paid for by T-Mobile. The cost of shares issued under this refer-a-friend program are included in Selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income ; \u2022 Weekly surprise items - Each Tuesday, eligible customers who download the T-Mobile Tuesday app are informed about and can redeem products and services offered by participating business partners. The associated cost is included in Selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income ; and \u2022 In-flight Wi-Fi - A full hour of in-flight Wi-Fi free to eligible customers on their smartphone on all Gogo-equipped domestic flights. The associated cost, which is paid by T-Mobile, is included in Cost of services in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Wireless Services Revenue We generate our wireless service revenues from providing access to, and usage of, our wireless communications network. Service revenues also include revenues earned for providing value added services to customers, such as handset insurance services. Service revenues are billed either in advance or arrears or are prepaid and are recognized when the service is rendered and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Revenues that are not reasonably assured to be collectible are recorded on a cash basis as payments are received. The recognition of prepaid revenue is deferred until services are rendered or the prepaid balance expires. Incentives given to customers are recorded as a reduction to revenue. We recognize service revenues for Data Stash plans when such services are delivered and the data is consumed, or at time of forfeiture or expiration. Revenues relating to unused data that is carried over to the following month are deferred and valued based on their relative standalone selling price. Revenue is recorded gross for arrangements involving the resale of third-party services where we are considered the primary obligor and is recorded net of associated costs incurred for services whereby we are not considered the primary obligor. Federal Universal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d) and other fees are assessed by various governmental authorities in connection with the services we provide to our customers. When we separately bill and collect these regulatory fees from customers, they are recorded gross in Total service revenues and cost of services in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . For the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , we recorded approximately $409 million , $334 million and $349 million , respectively, of USF and other fees on a gross basis. Equipment Revenues We generate equipment revenues from the sale or lease of mobile communication devices and accessories. Device and accessory sales revenues are generally recognized when the products are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer or dealer. We defer a portion of equipment revenues and cost of equipment sales for expected device returns based on historical experience. We offer certain customers the option to pay for devices and accessories in installments using an EIP. See EIP Receivables section above for further information. In addition, for customers enrolled in JUMP!, we separate the JUMP! trade-in right from the multiple element arrangement at its fair value and defer the portion of revenue which represents the fair value of the trade-in right. See Guarantee Liabilities section above for further information. In 2015, we introduced JUMP! On Demand, which allows customers to lease a device and upgrade their leased wireless device for a new one up to three times in a 12 month period. Leased wireless devices are accounted for as operating leases and lease revenues are recognized as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The residual value of purchased leased devices is recorded as equipment revenues and cost of equipment sales. See Property and Equipment section above for further information. Rent Expense We have operating leases for cell sites, retail locations, corporate offices and dedicated transportation lines, some of which have escalating rentals during the initial lease term and during subsequent optional renewal periods. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis, over the non-cancelable lease term and renewal periods that are considered reasonably assured at the inception of the lease. We consider several factors in assessing whether renewal periods are reasonably assured of being exercised, including the continued maturation of our network nationwide, technological advances within the telecommunications industry and the availability of alternative sites. Advertising Expense We expense the cost of advertising and other promotional expenditures to market our services and products as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , advertising expenses included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income were $1.7 billion , $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available. We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of adjustments, net of tax, related to unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities. This is reported in AOCI as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity until realized in earnings. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and performance-based restricted stock units (\u201cPRSUs\u201d), is measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized as expe"]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies Commitments Operating Leases and Purchase Commitments Future minimum payments for non-cancelable operating leases and purchase commitments are summarized below: (in millions) Operating Leases Purchase Commitments Year Ending December 31, 2017 $ 2,417 $ 2,011 2018 2,118 977 2019 1,832 841 2020 1,511 704 2021 1,102 626 Thereafter 2,188 960 Total $ 11,168 $ 6,119 Operating Leases We have operating leases for cell sites, switch sites, retail stores and office facilities with contractual terms expiring through 2026 . The majority of cell site leases have an initial non-cancelable term of five years to ten years with several renewal options. Historically, our assessment of cell site lease terms included renewal options on certain cell site leases which were reasonably assured of exercise and we had included such renewal options in the future minimum lease payments presented in the Operating Lease and Purchase Commitments table, above. As of December 31, 2016, we have updated the future minimum lease payments for all cell site leases presented above to include only payments due for the initial non-cancelable lease term as they represent the payments which we cannot avoid at our option and also correspond to our lease term assessment for new leases. This update had the effect of reducing our contractual operating lease commitments included in the table above by $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2016 . In addition, we have operating leases for dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms through 2026 . As of December 31, 2016 , we were contingently liable for future ground lease payments related to the tower obligations. These contingent obligations are not included in the above table as the amounts due are contractually owed by CCI based on the subleasing arrangement. See Note 8 \u2013 Tower Obligations for further information. Total rent expense under operating leases, including dedicated transportation lines, was $2.8 billion , $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and is classified as Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income . Purchase Commitments We have commitments for non-dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms through 2028 . In addition, we have commitments to purchase spectrum licenses, handsets, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business, with various terms through 2028 . These amounts are not reflective of our entire anticipated purchases under the related agreements, but are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually obligated. Related-Party Commitments In 2016 , T-Mobile USA entered into three purchase agreements with Deutsche Telekom under which T-Mobile USA may, at its option, issue and sell to Deutsche Telekom certain Senior Notes. The purchase agreements were amended in October 2016. See Note 7 \u2013 Debt for further information. In January 2017, T-Mobile USA borrowed $4.0 billion under a secured term loan facility (\u201cIncremental Term Loan Facility\u201d) with Deutsche Telekom to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding secured term loans under its Term Loan Credit Agreement dated November 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction intended to be used to redeem callable high yield debt. The loans under the Incremental Term Loan Facility were drawn in two tranches on January 31, 2017 (i) $2.0 billion of which will bear interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% and will mature on November 9, 2022 and (ii) $2.0 billion of which will bear interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% and will mature on January 31, 2024. The Incremental Term Loan Facility increases Deutsche Telekom\u2019s incremental term loan commitment provided to T-Mobile USA under that certain First Incremental Facility Amendment dated as of December 29, 2016 from $660 million to $2.0 billion and provides to T-Mobile USA an additional $2.0 billion incremental term loan commitment. See Note 14 \u2013 Subsequent Events for further information. In December 2016, T-Mobile USA also entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom which comprised of (i) a three-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement and (ii) a three-year $1.5 billion senior secured revolving credit agreement. As of December 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. See Note 7 \u2013 Debt for further information. Contingencies and Litigation We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings (\u201cLitigation Matters\u201d) that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include numerous court actions alleging that we are infringing various patents. Virtually all of the patent infringement cases are brought by non-practicing entities and effectively seek only monetary damages, although they occasionally seek injunctive relief as well. The Litigation Matters described above have progressed to various stages and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing or other adjudication that could include an award of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months, if they are not otherwise resolved. We have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate, which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements but that we do not consider, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where we have not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we have not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including but not limited to: uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; uncertain damage theories and demands; and a less than fully developed factual record. While we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, an unfavorable outcome of some or all of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future."]}, "Debt": NaN, "external_audit": "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of T-Mobile US, Inc.   \n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, of stockholders\u2019 equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its subsidiaries   at December 31, 2016   and December 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   December 31, 2016   in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nFebruary 14, 2017   \n\nT-Mobile US, Inc. \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n\n (in millions, except share and per share amounts) \n\nDecember 31, 2016 \n\n\u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1283699/000128369917000010/tmus12312016form10-k.htm"}, "2015": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": {"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": ["Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business T-Mobile US, Inc. (\u201cT-Mobile\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a leading provider of mobile communications services, including voice, messaging and data, under its flagship brands, T-Mobile and MetroPCS, in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d), Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. T-Mobile provides mobile communications services primarily using 4G Long-Term Evolution (\u201cLTE\u201d) technology. T-Mobile also offers a wide selection of wireless devices, including handsets, tablets and other mobile communication devices, and accessories for sale, as well as financing through equipment installment plans (\u201cEIP\u201d) and leasing through JUMP On Demand\u2122. Additionally, T-Mobile provides reinsurance for handset insurance policies and extended warranty contracts offered to T-Mobile\u2019s mobile communications customers. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the balances and results of operations of T-Mobile and its consolidated subsidiaries. T-Mobile operates as a single operating segment. T-Mobile consolidates majority-owned subsidiaries over which it exercises control, as well as variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) where it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and VIEs which cannot be deconsolidated. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. Examples include service revenues earned but not yet billed, service revenues billed but not yet earned, relative selling prices, allowances for uncollectible accounts and sales returns, discounts for imputed interest on EIP receivables, guarantee liabilities, losses incurred but not yet reported, tax liabilities, deferred income taxes including valuation allowances, useful lives of long-lived assets, cost estimates of asset retirement obligations, residual values on leased handsets, reasonably assured renewal terms for operating leases, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, and fair value measurements related to goodwill, spectrum licenses, intangible assets, and derivative financial instruments. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Short-Term Investments The Company's short-term investments consist of U.S. Treasury securities classified as available for sale, which are stated at fair value and have remaining maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase. Unrealized gains and losses, net of related income taxes, for available for sale securities are reported as net increases and decreases to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity, until realized. The estimated fair values of investments are based on quoted market prices as of the end of the reporting period. The U.S. Treasury securities reported as of December 31, 2015 have contractual maturities of less than one year. Available-for-sale securities are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more often if a potential loss-triggering event occurs. If there has been a decline in the fair value below the amortized cost basis, the Company determines whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors considered in the assessment include the reason for the decline in fair value, the Company\u2019s intent to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If an impairment is considered other-than-temporary, the Company records a charge to Other income (expense), net . Accounts Receivable and Allowances Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts billed and currently due from customers, other carriers and third-party retail channels (\u201cdealers\u201d), as well as revenues earned but not yet billed at the end of each period. T-Mobile has an arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. T-Mobile maintains an allowance for estimated losses inherent in the accounts receivable portfolio based on a number of factors, including historical experience and current collection trends, aging of the receivable portfolio, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions. The Company writes off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date. Equipment Installment Plan Receivables The Company offers certain retail customers the option to pay for devices and other accessories in installments using an EIP. At the time of an installment sale, the Company imputes a discount for interest as there is no stated rate of interest on the EIP receivables and records the EIP receivables at their present value, which is determined by discounting future payments at the imputed interest rate. The difference between the present value of the EIP receivables and their face amount results in a discount which is recorded as a direct reduction to the carrying value with a corresponding reduction to equipment revenues. T-Mobile determines the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the amount of expected credit losses on the EIP receivables. As a result, T-Mobile does not recognize a separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. The imputed discount on EIP receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as interest income in Other income (expense), net . Subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, T-Mobile assesses the need for and, if necessary, recognizes an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross EIP receivable balances exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances. The allowance is based on a number of factors, including collection experience, aging of the EIP receivable portfolio, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions. T-Mobile writes off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date. Equipment sales not reasonably assured to be collectible are recorded on a cash basis as payments are received. The current portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables, net and the long-term portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net . T-Mobile has an arrangement to sell certain EIP receivables on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets. Inventories Inventories consist primarily of wireless devices and accessories, which are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using standard cost which approximates average cost. Shipping and handling costs paid to wireless device and accessories vendors, and costs to refurbish used devices recovered through the Company\u2019s device trade-in and upgrade programs are included in the standard cost of inventory. T-Mobile records inventory write-downs to net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving items based on inventory turnover trends and historical experience. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets include assets that do not have indefinite lives, such as property and equipment and other intangible assets. The Company assesses potential impairments to its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indicators are present, the Company tests recoverability. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the asset or asset group\u2019s carrying amount, then an impairment loss is recorded, measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of buildings and equipment, wireless communication systems, leasehold improvements, capitalized software, leased wireless devices and construction in progress. Buildings and equipment include certain network server equipment. Wireless communication systems include assets to operate the Company\u2019s wireless network and IT data centers, including tower asset leaseholds, assets related to the liability for the retirement of long-lived assets and capital leases. Leasehold improvements include asset improvements other than those related to the wireless network. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments, if any. T-Mobile generally depreciates property and equipment on a straight-line basis. In 2015, T-Mobile introduced JUMP! On Demand which allows customers to lease a device and upgrade it for a new one up to three times in a 12 month period. To date, all of T-Mobile\u2019s leased devices were classified as operating leases by considering critical elements of the lease arrangement such as the lease term and the economic life, fair value and residual value of the device. At operating lease inception, leased wireless devices are transferred from inventory to property and equipment. Leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to T-Mobile, which is generally the lease term. Revenues associated with the leased wireless devices, net of incentives, are generally recognized over the lease term. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. Returned devices are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write down to market recognized as cost of equipment sales. Costs of major replacements and improvements are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures which do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Construction costs, labor and overhead incurred in the expansion or enhancement of T-Mobile\u2019s wireless network are capitalized. Capitalization commences with pre-construction period administrative and technical activities, which includes obtaining leases, zoning approvals and building permits, and ceases at the point at which the asset is ready for its intended use. The Company capitalizes interest associated with the acquisition or construction of certain property and equipment. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated over the useful life of the related assets. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of useful lives for certain categories of property and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book value is depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease term. Future obligations related to capital leases are included in Short-term debt and Long-term debt . Depreciation of assets held under capital leases is included in Depreciation and amortization expense. The Company records an asset retirement obligation for the fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, the Company recognizes changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. The Company\u2019s obligations relate primarily to certain legal obligations to remediate leased property on which the Company\u2019s network infrastructure and administrative assets are located. The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or acquiring internal use software. Capitalization of software costs commences once the final selection of the specific software solution has been made and management authorizes and commits to funding the software project. Capitalized software costs are included in Property and equipment, net and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well as maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred. Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets that do not have indefinite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Customer lists are amortized using the sum-of-the-years-digits method over the expected period in which the relationship is expected to contribute to future cash flows. The remaining finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Spectrum Licenses Spectrum licenses are carried at costs incurred to acquire the spectrum licenses and the costs to prepare the spectrum licenses for their intended use, such as costs to clear acquired spectrum licenses. The Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) issues spectrum licenses which provide T-Mobile with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum within specific geographic service areas to provide wireless communication services. While spectrum licenses are issued for a fixed period of time, typically for up to fifteen years, the FCC has granted license renewals routinely and at a nominal cost. The spectrum licenses held by the Company expire at various dates. The Company believes it will be able to meet all requirements necessary to secure renewal of its spectrum licenses at nominal costs. Moreover, the Company has determined there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of its spectrum licenses. Therefore, the Company has determined the spectrum licenses should be treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company at times enters into agreements to sell or exchange spectrum licenses. Upon entering into the arrangement, if the transaction has been deemed to have commercial substance, spectrum licenses are reviewed for impairment and transferred at their carrying value, net of any impairment, to assets held for sale included in other current assets until approval and completion of the exchange or sale. Upon closing of the transaction, spectrum licenses acquired as part of an exchange of nonmonetary assets are valued at fair value. The difference between the fair value of the spectrum licenses obtained, book value of the spectrum licenses transferred and cash paid, if any, is recognized as gains included in Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses . If the transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value is not measurable, the acquired spectrum licenses are recorded at the book value of the assets tendered. Impairment The Company assesses the carrying value of its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (spectrum licenses) for potential impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired. The Company may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If the Company does not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two-step test. In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is performed. In the second step, the Company determines the fair values of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including those that may not be currently recorded. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the fair value of all of those assets and liabilities represents the implied goodwill amount. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. The Company tests its spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with the Company's management of the overall business at a national level. The Company may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset group is less than its carrying value. If the Company does not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset group is less than its carrying amount, the Company calculates the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. If the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. The Company estimates fair value using the Greenfield approach, which is an income approach, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Guarantee Liabilities The Company offers a device trade-in program, Just Upgrade My Phone (\u201cJUMP!\u201d), which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. Participating customers must purchase a device from T-Mobile, have a qualifying monthly wireless service plan with T-Mobile, and finance their device using an EIP, which is treated as a single multiple-element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time. Upon qualifying JUMP! program upgrades, the customers\u2019 remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new device from T-Mobile on a new EIP. For customers who enroll in the device trade-in program, the Company defers the portion of revenue which represents the estimated value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The guarantee liabilities are valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, including the customer's estimated remaining EIP balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used handset at trade-in, and probability and timing of trade-in. T-Mobile assesses guarantee liabilities at each reporting date to determine if facts and circumstances would indicate the incurrence of incremental contingent liabilities is probable and if so, reasonably estimable. The recognition and subsequent adjustments of the contingent guarantee liability as a result of these assessments are recorded as adjustments to revenue. When customers upgrade their devices, the difference between the trade-in credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned devices is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. Guarantee liabilities included in Other current liabilities were $163 million and $286 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The estimated EIP receivable balance if all enrolled handset upgrade program customers were to claim their benefit, not including any trade-in value of the required used handset, was $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2015 . This is not an indication of the Company\u2019s expected loss exposure as it does not consider the expected fair value of the used handset, which is required to be in good working condition at trade-in, nor does it consider the probability and timing of trade-in. Fair Value Measurements The Company carries certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs based on the observability as of the measurement date, is as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; and Level 3 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require T-Mobile to develop assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company\u2019s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities being measured within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts receivable from affiliates and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying values of EIP receivables approximate fair value as the receivables are recorded at their present value, net of unamortized discount and allowance for credit losses. There were no financial instruments with a carrying value materially different from their fair value, based on quoted market prices or rates for the same or similar instruments, or internal valuation models. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments primarily relate to embedded derivatives for certain components of the reset feature of the Senior Reset Notes to affiliates which are required to be bifurcated and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in Interest expense to affiliates . T-Mobile does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Revenue Recognition T-Mobile offers products and services to customers through bundled arrangements, which may be comprised of multiple contracts entered into with a customer at or near the same time. The Company assesses such agreements as a single bundled arrangement that may involve multiple deliverables, which include wireless devices, wireless services or a combination thereof. For multiple deliverable arrangements revenue is allocated between the separate units of accounting, based on such components\u2019 relative selling prices on a standalone basis. Revenues primarily consist of wireless service revenues from providing access to and usage of the Company's wireless communications network, equipment revenues generated from device sales and revenues from leasing a device through JUMP! On Demand. Service revenues also include revenues earned for providing value added services to customers, such as handset insurance services. Service revenues are billed either in advance or arrears or are prepaid and are recognized when the service is rendered and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Revenues that are not reasonably assured to be collectible are recorded on a cash basis as payments are received. The recognition of prepaid revenue is deferred until services are rendered or the prepaid balance expires. Incentives given to customers are recorded as a reduction to revenue. T-Mobile recognizes service revenues for Data Stash plans when such services are delivered and the data is consumed, or at time of forfeiture or expiration. Revenues relating to unused data that is carried over to the following month are deferred and valued based on their relative standalone selling price. Revenue is recorded gross for arrangements involving the resale of third-party services where T-Mobile is considered the primary obligor and is recorded net of associated costs incurred for services whereby T-Mobile is not considered the primary obligor. Equipment revenues are comprised of revenues from the sale or lease of mobile communication devices and accessories. Device and accessory sales revenues are generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer or dealer. The Company defers a portion of equipment revenues and cost of equipment sales for expected device returns based on historical experience. The Company offers certain customers the option to pay for devices and accessories in installments using an EIP. See Equipment Installment Plan Receivables for further information. In addition, the Company offers customers a device trade-in program, JUMP!, which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. For customers enrolled in JUMP!, the Company separates the JUMP! trade-in right from the multiple element arrangement at its fair value and defers the portion of revenue which represents the fair value of the trade-in right. See Guarantee Liabilities for further information. In 2015, T-Mobile introduced JUMP! On Demand, which allows customers to lease a device and upgrade their leased wireless device for a new one up to three times in a 12 month period. Leased wireless devices are accounted for as operating leases and equipment revenues are recognized as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Previously leased devices that are purchased by the customer are recorded at their residual value as equipment revenues and cost of equipment sales. See Property and Equipment for further information. Federal Universal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d) and other fees are assessed by various governmental authorities in connection with the services the Company provides to its customers. When the Company separately bills and collects these regulatory fees from customers, they are recorded gross in service revenues and cost of services. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the Company recorded approximately $334 million , $349 million and $362 million , respectively, of USF and other fees on a gross basis. Rent Expense The Company has operating leases for cell sites, retail locations, corporate offices and dedicated transportation lines, some of which have escalating rentals during the initial lease term and during subsequent optional renewal periods. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis, over the non-cancelable lease term and renewal periods that are considered reasonably assured at the inception of the lease. Advertising Expense T-Mobile expenses the cost of advertising and other promotional expenditures to market the T-Mobile\u2019s services and products as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , advertising expenses included in Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.6 billion , $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion , respectively. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available. T-Mobile accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjusts the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2015-17 (Topic 740), \u201cBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\u201d, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-17 for the year ended December 31, 2015 on a prospective basis. Adoption of this ASU resulted in a reclassification of the Company\u2019s current deferred tax assets, net to non-current deferred tax liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015 . Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of adjustments, net of tax, related to unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedging derivatives and unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency translation. These are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d) as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity until realized in earnings. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\u201cRSU\u201d) and performance stock units (\u201cPSU\u201d), is measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of expected forfeitures, over the related service period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of T-Mobile common stock on the date of grant. RSUs are recognized as expense using the straight-line method. PSUs are recognized as expense following a graded vesting schedule. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing Net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of outstanding stock options, RSUs and PSUs, calculated using the treasury stock method, and mandatory convertible preferred stock (\u201cpreferred stock\u201d), calculated using the if-converted method. Variable Interest Entities VIEs are entities which lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, have equity investors which do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations through voting rights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most common type of VIE is a special purpose entity (\u201cSPE\u201d). SPEs are commonly used in secu"]}, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["Note 13 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies Commitments Future minimum payments for non-cancelable operating leases and purchase commitments are summarized below: (in millions) Operating Leases Purchase Commitments Year Ending December 31, 2016 $ 2,379 $ 2,865 2017 2,235 3,150 2018 2,046 772 2019 1,900 714 2020 1,679 629 Thereafter 5,583 1,304 Total $ 15,822 $ 9,434 Operating Leases T-Mobile has operating leases for cell sites, switch sites, retail stores and office facilities with contractual terms expiring through 2030 . The majority of cell site leases have an initial non-cancelable term of five years to ten years with several renewal options. The Company considers renewal options certain on leases as being reasonably assured of exercise, thus included in future minimum lease payments for a total term of approximately 15 years . In addition, T-Mobile has operating leases for dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms through 2025 . As of December 31, 2015 , T-Mobile was contingently liable for future ground lease payments related to the tower obligations. These contingent obligations are not included in the above table as the amounts due are contractually owed by CCI based on the subleasing arrangement. See Note 9 \u2013 Tower Obligations for further information. Total rent expense under operating leases, including dedicated transportation lines, was $2.8 billion , $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Purchase Commitments T-Mobile has commitments for non-dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms through 2028 . In addition, T-Mobile has commitments to purchase spectrum licenses, handsets, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business, with various terms through 2028 . These amounts are not reflective of the Company\u2019s entire anticipated purchases under the related agreements, but are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which the Company was contractually obligated. Contingencies and Litigation T-Mobile is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include numerous court actions alleging that T-Mobile is infringing various patents. Virtually all of the patent infringement cases are brought by non-practicing entities and effectively seek only monetary damages, although they occasionally seek injunctive relief as well. The matters described above have progressed to various stages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. T-Mobile has established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate, which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements but that T-Mobile does not consider, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when T-Mobile believes it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where the Company has not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company has not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including but not limited to: uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; uncertain damage theories and demands; and a less than fully developed factual record. While T-Mobile does not expect that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, an unfavorable outcome of some or all of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on T-Mobile\u2019s current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, T-Mobile\u2019s view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future. On April 4, 2012, T-Mobile was sued in a patent infringement case by Prism Technologies LLC (\u201cPrism\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska, asserting claims relating to patents that Prism claims are related to authentication and use of the internet by T-Mobile\u2019s network, and sought damages of up to $114.9 million . On October 30, 2015, the jury reached a verdict in favor of T-Mobile, finding non-infringement on all patents; and judgment was entered for T-Mobile on November 20, 2015. Both Prism and T-Mobile have filed post-trial motions, which are pending. The Company does not believe that a loss is probable or that the amount of a loss can be reasonably estimated at this time, and does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this case will have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows."]}, "Debt": {"Debt": ["Note 8 \u2013 Debt Debt was as follows: (in millions) December 31, December 31, 5.250% Senior Notes due 2018 $ 500 $ 500 6.288% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2019 1,250 1,250 6.464% Senior Notes due 2019 1,250 1,250 6.366% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2020 1,250 1,250 6.542% Senior Notes due 2020 1,250 1,250 6.625% Senior Notes due 2020 1,000 1,000 6.250% Senior Notes due 2021 1,750 1,750 6.633% Senior Notes due 2021 1,250 1,250 8.097% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2021 1,250 1,250 6.125% Senior Notes due 2022 1,000 1,000 6.731% Senior Notes due 2022 1,250 1,250 8.195% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2022 1,250 1,250 5.950% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2023 (reset date in April 2016) 600 600 6.000% Senior Notes due 2023 1,300 1,300 6.625% Senior Notes due 2023 1,750 1,750 6.836% Senior Notes due 2023 600 600 6.500% Senior Notes due 2024 1,000 1,000 6.375% Senior Notes due 2025 1,700 1,700 6.500% Senior Notes due 2026 2,000 \u2014 Senior Secured Term Loans 2,000 \u2014 Unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment 250 286 Unamortized discount on Senior Secured Term Loans (10 ) \u2014 Capital leases 826 410 Financing arrangements \u2014 64 Total debt 26,266 21,960 Less: Current portion of Senior Secured Term Loans 20 \u2014 Less: Current portion of capital leases 162 23 Less: Financing arrangements \u2014 64 Total long-term debt $ 26,084 $ 21,873 Classified on the balance sheet as: Long-term debt $ 20,484 $ 16,273 Long-term debt to affiliates 5,600 5,600 Total long-term debt $ 26,084 $ 21,873 Long-term Debt In 2015 , T-Mobile USA issued $2.0 billion of 6.500% Senior Notes due 2026, for which T-Mobile and certain subsidiaries are guarantors.

T-Mobile USA\u2019s obligations under the agreement are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of T-Mobile USA\u2019s assets and the assets of T-Mobile USA\u2019s subsidiaries that are guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the Senior Secured Term Loans are subject to a first priority pledge of the equity interests held by T-Mobile USA and substantially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. See Note 15 \u2013 Guarantor Financial Information for further information regarding the condensed consolidating financial information of T-Mobile\u2019s guarantor subsidiaries. Interest on the Senior Notes to third parties is accrued from the date of issuance at stated interest rates and paid semi-annually. Interest on the Senior Secured Term Loans is accrued from the date of issuance equal to London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus a margin rate of 2.750% and is paid quarterly. The Senior Secured Term Loans had an effective interest rate of 3.500% as of December 31, 2015 . Principal on the Senior Secured Term Loans is paid quarterly equal to 0.250% of the principal amount with the remaining balance of the principal due on the final maturity date in November 2022 . The interest rate on the 5.950% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2023 will adjust at the reset date to a rate defined in the applicable supplemental indenture. The long-term debt may be redeemed or prepaid, as applicable, in whole or from time to time in part, at specified redemption prices or prepayment premiums, as applicable. The long-term debt may also be redeemed by the Company using make-whole call or breakage provisions or in part with equity proceeds. All redemptions are subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable supplemental indenture or Term Loan Credit Agreement. In 2015, the interest rate on certain Senior Reset Notes to affiliates were adjusted as follows: December 31, 2015 Current Rate Previous Rate 6.288% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2019 6.288 % 5.578 % 6.366% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2020 6.366 % 5.656 % 8.097% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2021 8.097 % 5.747 % 8.195% Senior Reset Notes to affiliates due 2022 8.195 % 5.845 % Capital Leases Capital lease agreements relate to network equipment with varying expiration terms through 2030 . Future minimum payments required under capital leases, including interest, over their remaining terms as of December 31, 2015 are expected to be $199 million for the year ending 2016 , $189 million in 2017 , $158 million in 2018 , $128 million in 2019 , $56 million in 2020 , and $267 million thereafter, for a total of $997 million , including $171 million in interest. Financing Arrangements T-Mobile maintains a handset financing arrangement with Deutsche Bank AG (\u201cDeutsche Bank\u201d), which allows for up to $108 million in borrowings. Under the handset financing arrangement, the Company can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain handset vendors. The interest rate on the handset financing arrangement is determined based on LIBOR plus a specified margin per the arrangement. Obligations under the handset financing arrangement are included in Short-term debt . In 2015 and 2014 , T-Mobile utilized and repaid $100 million under the financing arrangement. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , there was no outstanding balance. The Company maintains vendor financing arrangements with its primary network equipment suppliers. Under the respective agreements, the Company can obtain extended financing terms. The interest rate on the vendor financing arrangements is determined based on the difference between LIBOR and a specified margin per the agreements. Obligations under the vendor financing arrangements are included in Short-term debt . As of December 31, 2015 there was no outstanding balance. As of December 31, 2014 the outstanding balance was $64 million . Lines and Standby Letters of Credit T-Mobile has an unsecured revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom which allows for up to $500 million in borrowings. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , T-Mobile had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. For the purposes of securing T-Mobile\u2019s obligations to provide handset insurance services, T-Mobile maintains an agreement for standby letters of credit with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cJP Morgan Chase\u201d). For purposes of securing T-Mobile\u2019s general purpose obligations, T-Mobile maintains a letter of credit reimbursement agreement with Deutsche Bank.

Contingencies": ["Commitments and Contingencies Indemnifications From time to time, the Company enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the Company to indemnify the Company's officers, directors, and employees for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship. Generally, a maximum obligation under these contracts is not explicitly stated. Because the maximum amounts associated with these agreements are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company has not been required to make payments under these obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Standby Letter of Credit During the course of business, the Company's bank issues standby letters of credit on behalf of the Company to certain vendors and other third parties of the Company. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total value of the letters of credit issued by the bank are $15.7 million and $16.5 million, respectively. No amounts have been drawn under the standby letter of credit. Commitments In June 2021, the Company entered into a promissory note with one of its customers pursuant to which the customer may draw amounts in a maximum aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. The amount of the draws is limited to the total amount incurred by subcontractors contracted by the Company in relation to the project. The promissory note is not a revolving facility, which means that outstanding amounts under the promissory note that are repaid cannot be re-borrowed. The promissory note has a maturity date of May 1, 2026. The promissory note bears no interest during the period between the first advance to the customer and the thirty-first month following the first advance, with interest increasing to an annual rate of 3.5% thereafter. As of December 31, 2022, the customer has a balance of $7.0 million drawn against the promissory note, which is recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Litigation and Environmental Settlements In December 2014, the Company finalized the terms of a litigation settlement with a third party where the Company agreed to pay the other party a total of $32.0 million periodically over the next 10 years. The Company recorded the present value of future payments as a liability and records interest expense, included in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, as it accretes the liability. The balances of the litigation settlement liability are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities, respectively, on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2022 2021 Litigation settlement liability - current $ 3,000 $ \u2014 Litigation settlement liability - non-current 5,794 7,834 Total litigation settlement liability $ 8,794 $ 7,834 In September and August of 2021, the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality (\u201cMCEQ\u201d), Desoto County Regional Utility Authority (\u201cDCRUA\u201d) and the City of Olive Branch, Mississippi (\u201cOlive Branch\u201d), each issued notices and orders to the Company with respect to our discharges of water from our Olive Branch facility into the publicly owned treatment works (\u201cPOTW\u201d) of DCRUA and Olive Branch without first obtaining a pretreatment permit. In August 2021, a Subpoena to Testify Before a Grand Jury was issued out of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi (\u201cSubpoena\u201d) requiring us to produce to the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) various documents relating to environmental matters at our Olive Branch facility, including but not limited to hazardous waste records, air emissions records, storm water discharges records and wastewater disposal records. We have cooperated fully with each such notice, order and Subpoena. On April 13, 2022, the Company and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi agreed in principle to the terms of a global settlement resolving the prospect of claims and charges against the Company relating to all prior discharges of water into the POTW of DCRUA and Olive Branch without first obtaining a pretreatment permit. The principal terms of the settlement are: 1. the Company pleading guilty to a single misdemeanor count for negligently discharging wastewater to a POTW without first obtaining a pretreatment permit in violation of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(c)(1)(A); 2. the Company paying a fine of $3.0 million over a three-year period in equal installments of $1.0 million to the federal government; 3. the Company paying a special assessment of $125 to the federal government pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013(a)(1)(B); 4. the Company entering a separate civil Agreed Order with the MCEQ that requires the payment of a separate civil penalty of $1.5 million; 5. the Company making a separate community service payment in the amount of $0.5 million to DCRUA, to be used for the sole purpose of expanding wastewater treatment capacity in DeSoto County, Mississippi, within 30 days of entering the Plea Agreement; 6. the Company implementing an environmental management system that conforms to ISO 14001:2015 standards or a similar environmental management system approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which is expected to result in $0.3 million in consulting and personnel costs; 7. the Company implementing agreed upon wastewater reduction plans, which is expected to result in approximately $5.5 million in capital expenditures to install a wastewater treatment and recycling system; 8. the Company obtaining a pretreatment permit from MDEQ, or entering an Agreed Order with MCEQ and operating in compliance with that Agreed Order until a permit can be obtained; 9. the Company obtaining wastewater discharge permits from DCRUA and Olive Branch, or entering into Consent/Compliance Order(s) or Agreement(s) with DCRUA and Olive Branch that are consistent with any Agreed Order entered with MCEQ and operating in compliance with such Consent/Compliance Order(s) or Agreement(s) until permits can be obtained; and 10. the Company agreeing to probation for three years. The terms of the Plea Agreement are subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. On November 7, 2022, View finalized an Agreed Order with the MCEQ as contemplated by the settlement terms. On November 16 and 17, 2022, Olive Branch and DCRUA, respectively, approved a joint Agreed Order with View consistent with the settlement terms. View continues to coordinate with MDEQ and the local authorities with respect to the obligations contemplated by the settlement terms, including obtaining a pretreatment permit from the Mississippi Environmental Quality Permit Board, which has not been granted as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company recognized the $5.0 million of penalties it expects to incur in conjunction with this settlement within other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of December 31, 2021. The balances of the environmental settlement liability are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities, respectively, on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2022 2021 Environmental settlement liability - current $ 1,450 $ 2,950 Environmental settlement liability - non-current 3,000 2,000 Total environmental settlement liability $ 4,450 $ 4,950 Litigation From time to time, the Company is subject to claims, litigation, internal or governmental investigations, including those related to labor and employment, contracts, intellectual property, environmental, regulatory compliance, commercial matters and other related matters, some of which allege substantial monetary damages and claims. Some of these actions may be brought as class actions on behalf of a class or purported class of employees. The Company is also defendants in judicial and administrative proceedings involving matters incidental to our business. Legal expenses are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues a charge when management determines that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a loss is probable, the Company records an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. When no point of loss is more likely than another, the Company records the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and discloses the estimated range. The Company does not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies but does disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and the Company is able to estimate such a range. If the Company cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses, the Company explains the factors that prevent it from determining such a range. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to it to determine whether an accrual should be established or adjusted. The ultimate outcome of legal proceedings involves judgments, estimates, and inherent uncertainties and cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the ultimate outcome of any legal matter be unfavorable, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The Company may also incur substantial legal fees, which are expensed as incurred, in defending against legal claims. Securities Litigation On August 18, 2021, plaintiff Asif Mehedi filed a putative securities class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (Mehedi v. View, Inc. f/k/a CF Finance Acquisition Corp. II et al. (No. 5:21CV06374, N.D. Cal.)) alleging violations of the federal securities laws by the Company, Rao Mulpuri, and Vidul Prakash. On February 8, 2022, the Court appointed Stadium Capital LLC lead plaintiff and denied the competing motion of Sweta Sonthalia. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Ms. Sonthalia\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus to vacate the lead plaintiff order. On July 15, 2022, Stadium Capital filed an amended complaint against View, Mulpuri, and Prakash; certain current and former View board members; Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and related entities; officers and board members of CF II; and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The action is brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of (i) all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired View and/or CF II securities between November 30, 2020 and May 10, 2022, inclusive; (ii) all persons or entities who were holders of CF II Class A common stock as of the January 27, 2021 record date that were entitled to vote to approve the merger between View and CF II; and (iii) all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired View securities pursuant or traceable to the Form S-4 Registration Statement filed by CF II on December 23, 2020. The amended complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) (and Rule 10b-5 thereunder), 14(a) (and Rule 14a-9 thereunder), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Sections 11, 12, and 15 of the Securities Act. The amended complaint alleges that certain defendants failed to disclose to investors that the Company\u2019s warranty-related obligations and associated cost of revenue were materially false and misleading because they excluded expenses the Company incurred and expected to incur due to significant quality issues. The amended complaint alleges that certain defendants\u2019 positive statements about the Company were false and materially misleading as a result, and that such statements caused the price of the Company\u2019s stock to be inflated. The amended complaint alleges that class members were damaged when the price of the Company\u2019s stock declined on the trading day following (1) August 16, 2021, when the Company announced an independent investigation concerning the adequacy of the Company\u2019s previously disclosed warranty accrual, and (2) May 10, 2022, when the Company stated that management anticipated that it would be disclosing substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and that the Company\u2019s cash position was $200.5 million at the end of Q1 2022. The amended complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages and costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees. Defendants filed motions to dismiss on October 6, 2022, Stadium Capital filed its opposition to the motions on November 14, 2022. Defendants filed replies in support of the motions to dismiss on December 14, 2022. The motions are set for hearing on April 20, 2023. Given the early stage of this matter, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss (or range of loss), if any, at this time; therefore, a liability has not been recorded as of December 31, 2022. Derivative Litigation On December 6, 2021, a purported Company shareholder filed a verified stockholder derivative complaint (nominally on behalf of the Company) against Rao Mulpuri, Nigel Gormly, Harold Hughes, Tom Leppert, Toby Cosgrove, Lisa Picard, Julie Larson-Green, and Vidul Prakash (Jacobson v. Mulpuri, et al. (No. 1:21CV01719, D. Del.)). On May 24, 2022, plaintiff and purported Company stockholder Anil Damidi filed a verified stockholder derivative complaint (nominally on behalf of the Company) against the same defendants as in the Jacobson complaint: Mr. Mulpuri, Mr. Gormly, Mr. Hughes, Mr. Leppert, Mr. Cosgrove, Ms. Picard, Ms. Larson-Green, and Mr. Prakash. On July 26, 2022, plaintiff and purported Company stockholder James Monteleone filed a verified stockholder derivative complaint (nominally on behalf of the Company) against the same defendants as in the Jacobson and Damidi complaints: Mr. Mulpuri, Mr. Gormly, Mr. Hughes, Mr. Leppert, Mr. Cosgrove, Ms. Picard, Ms. Larson-Green, and Mr. Prakash. On September 8, 2022, the Jacobson, Damidi, and Monteleone cases were assigned to Judge Gregory Williams. On September 30, 2022, Judge Williams entered the parties\u2019 stipulation to (1) consolidate the three actions into In re View, Inc. Derivative Litigation, C.A. No, 21-1719-GBW (Consolidated), (2) appoint co-lead counsel for plaintiffs, and (3) stay all proceedings in the consolidated action until the Mehedi class action is dismissed in its entirety, with prejudice, and all appeals related thereto have been exhausted, or is resolved by settlement, or the motions to dismiss in the Mehedi class action are denied. Any party may request that the Court lift the stay upon good cause shown and bringing the matter to the Court\u2019s attention. The stipulation deems the Damidi complaint to be the operative complaint in the consolidated case until any amended complaint is filed. The Damidi complaint asserts claims for violation of Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets. The complaint seeks unspecified money damages, restitution, punitive damages, and costs (including attorneys\u2019 fees and accountants\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses). The Damidi complaint alleges that the defendants failed to prevent the Company from making false statements regarding the Company\u2019s business results and prospects and that the Company has been harmed by incurring legal fees and potential liability in investigations and lawsuits. Given the early stage of this matter, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss (or range of loss), if any, at this time; therefore, a liability has not been recorded as of December 31, 2022. Government Investigation On November 9, 2021, the Company announced that it had voluntarily reported to the SEC that the audit committee of the Company\u2019s board of directors was conducting an independent, internal investigation into the adequacy of the Company\u2019s previously reported warranty accrual. In January 2022, the Company was informed that the SEC is conducting a formal investigation of this matter. The Company has cooperated with the SEC\u2019s investigation and intends to continue doing so. In June 2022, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York requested information related to this matter. The Company has cooperated with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in connection with these requests and intends to continue doing so. Given the early stage of these matters, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss (or range of loss), if any, at this time; therefore, a liability has not been recorded as of December 31, 2022."]}, "Debt": {"Debt": ["Debt Debt outstanding consisted of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2022 2021 Convertible Notes, net of debt issuance costs $ 206,347 $ \u2014 Term loan 13,960 15,430 Total debt 220,307 15,430 Debt, current 1,470 1,470 Debt, non-current $ 218,837 $ 13,960 Principal payments on all debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022 are estimated as follows (in thousands): Fiscal year ended December 31, Total 2023 $ 1,470 2024 1,470 2025 1,470 2026 1,470 Thereafter 214,427 Total $ 220,307 Convertible Notes The following table presents the Company\u2019s convertible debt outstanding (in thousands): December 31, 2022 Gross amount Debt discount and issuance costs Carrying amount Estimated fair value Convertible Notes $ 212,308 (5,961) $ 206,347 $ 199,163 The following table presents the Company\u2019s interest expense related to convertible debt (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2022 Contractual interest expense $ 3,309 Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs 389 Total interest expense $ 3,698 In October 2022, the Company completed the sale of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s 6.00% / 9.00% Convertible Senior PIK Toggle Notes (the \u201cInitial Notes\u201d), with the option to sell an additional $40.0 million of Notes to the Purchasers. In December 2022, the Company received notices from certain Purchasers that had elected to exercise their respective options to purchase an aggregate additional $12.3 million of notes (the \u201cAdditional Notes\u201d). Such Additional Notes were issued in December 2022. The Initial Notes and the Additional Notes, which will be collectively referred to as the Convertible Notes, will mature on October 1, 2027. The Convertible Notes were sold in a private placement in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes were approximately $206.3 million after deducting fees and offering expenses. The debt discount and issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization, are reported as a direct deduction from the face amount of the Convertible Notes. The Company expects to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Convertible Notes bear interest at 6.00% per annum, to the extent paid in cash (\u201cCash Interest\u201d), and 9.00% per annum, to the extent paid in kind through the issuance of additional Convertible Notes (\u201cPIK Interest\u201d). Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1st and October 1st of each year, beginning on April 1, 2023. The Company can elect to make any interest payment through Cash Interest, PIK Interest or any combination thereof. The Convertible Notes are convertible, based on the applicable conversion rate, into cash, shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock or a combination thereof, at the Company\u2019s election. The initial conversion rate was 747.6636 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustment in certain circumstances, which represented an initial conversion price of approximately $1.34 per share. The Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Convertible Notes. In connection with the Closing, the Company entered into letter agreements with certain holders of the Convertible Notes (the \u201cBlocker Agreements\u201d). The Blocker Agreements provide, among other things, that the Convertible Notes held by the entities affiliated with certain holders (each, a \u201cBlocker Party\u201d), shall not be converted to the extent that such conversion would cause a Blocker Party to beneficially own more than a specified threshold percentage (as may be increased or decreased by the applicable Blocker Party upon 61 days\u2019 written notice) of the Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company outstanding immediately following such conversion. The Company may redeem the Convertible Notes in whole or in part, at its option, on or after October 1, 2025, and prior to the 41st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, for cash at the applicable redemption price if the last reported sale price of the Common Stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides the applicable redemption notice. The redemption price will be equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, a holder may elect to convert its Convertible Notes during any such redemption period, in which case the applicable conversion rate may be increased in certain circumstances if Convertible Notes are converted after they are called for redemption. Additionally, if the Company undergoes a fundamental change transaction (each such term as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes), subject to certain conditions, holders may require the Company to purchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes. The fundamental change repurchase price will be 100% of the capitalized principal amount of the Convertible Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The indenture governing the Convertible Notes contains customary terms and covenants, including certain events of default in which case either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes may declare 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Convertible Notes to be due and payable immediately. As of December 31, 2022, the effective interest rate on the Convertible Notes was 9.68%. Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs is reported as a component of interest expenses and is computed using the straight-line method over the term of the Convertible Notes, which approximates the effective interest method. The estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2022 using Level 3 fair value inputs was $199.2 million. Term Loan On November 22, 2010, the Company entered into a debt arrangement with a lender, in an amount of $40.0 million (\"Term Loan\"), for the purpose of financing equipment and tenant improvements at its manufacturing facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. Pursuant to the original terms, the loan provides for interest-free debt to be repaid in semi-annual payments due on June 30 and December 31 each year. The loan was originally being paid over 24 semi-annual installments through June 30, 2024. On October 22, 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated debt arrangement with the lender. The amended and restated debt arrangement temporarily suspended the payments. Starting June 30, 2022, the Company is required to make semi-annual payments of $0.7 million through June 30, 2032. The term loan agreement required the Company to invest certain amounts in land, building and equipment and create a certain number of jobs. The term loan agreement, as amended, also includes a covenant for audited consolidated financial statements to be delivered to the lender within 210 days of the Company\u2019s fiscal year end. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. Revolving Debt Facility In October 2019, the Company entered into a secured revolving debt facility pursuant to which the Company may draw amounts in a maximum aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million until January 3, 2020 and $250.0 million after such date, for the purpose of paying payables and other corporate obligations. In October 2019, the Company drew a principal amount of $150.0 million under the facility with weekly maturity dates ranging from 8 days to 364 days. In May 2020, the Company drew the remaining principal amount of $100.0 million available under the facility, which was repayable on May 1, 2021. The facility's original expiration was October 22, 2023, at which time all drawn amounts were to be repaid in full. The interest rate applicable to amounts outstanding under the facility was LIBOR, plus 9.05%. As security for the payment and performance of all obligations under the facility, the Company granted the finance provider a security interest in substantially all of the Company's assets. Under the original agreement, repaid principal amounts became immediately available to be redrawn under the facility with maturity dates of one year through October 23, 2022. As of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s available borrowing capacity was nil. As of December 31, 2020, the Company classified the outstanding balance of $250.0 million as a current liability because the Company was in violation of the stockholders\u2019 equity covenant as of such date and the limited waiver from the finance provider waived such violation only through March 31, 2021. In December 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to replace thirteen weekly draws of approximately $2.9 million each, aggregating to $37.5 million in principal amount, with four notes of approximately $9.4 million each, aggregating to $37.5 million in principal amount. On March 8, 2021, upon Closing, the facility was repaid in full in the amount of $276.8 million, including accrued interest and future interest through maturity of the notes of $26.8 million prior to the expiration of the limited waiver from the finance provider. Upon repayment of its obligation, the Company recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $10.0 million, and the facility was terminated."]}, "external_audit": "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID No. 238 ) \n\nConsolidated Financial Statements: Consolidated Balance Sheets \n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss \n\nConsolidated Statements of Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders\u2019 Equity (Deficit) \n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of View, Inc. \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of View, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, of redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit) and of cash flows for the years then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nSubstantial Doubt about the Company\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern \n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, since its inception the Company has not achieved profitable operations or positive cash flows from operations and has an accumulated deficit that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nProduct Warranties - Specific Warranty Liability for Certain Insulating Glass Units \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2019, the Company identified a quality issue with certain material purchased from one of its suppliers utilized in the manufacturing of certain Insulating Glass Units (IGU). The Company stopped using the affected materials upon identification of the quality issue in 2019. The Company has replaced and expects to continue to replace the affected IGUs for the remainder of the period covered by the warranty. Management developed a statistical model to analyze the risk of failure of the affected IGUs related to this quality issue and predict the potential number of future failures that may occur during the remaining warranty period, as well as the timing of the expected failures. Management judgment is necessary to determine the distribution fit and covariates utilized in the statistical model, as well as the relative tolerance to declare convergence. The statistical model considered the volume of units sold, the volume of unit failures, data patterns, and other characteristics associated with the failed IGUs as well as the IGUs that had not yet failed as of each financial reporting period. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, time to failure, manufacture date, location of installation, and environmental factors. Based on this analysis, management has recorded a specific warranty \n\nliability using the estimated number of affected IGUs expected to fail in the remaining warranty period and applying estimated costs management expects to incur to replace the IGUs based on warranty contractual terms and business practices. Considering the uncertainty inherent in the failure analysis, including the actual timing of the failures and the number of defective IGUs, as well as uncertainty regarding future supply chain costs and production volumes that may impact the projected costs to replace defective IGUs in future years, it is reasonably possible that the amount of costs to be incurred to replace the defective IGUs could ultimately be materially different from the estimate. The total warranty liability included $30.8 million as of December 31, 2022, related to these IGUs. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the specific warranty liability for certain IGUs is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the specific warranty liability for certain IGUs due to the use of a statistical model to estimate the affected IGUs expected to fail in the remaining warranty period and the judgment required to estimate the costs to replace the affected IGUs, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management\u2019s estimate of affected IGUs expected to fail in the remaining warranty period and to evaluate the significant assumptions related to the convergence thresholds used in the statistical model and the estimated costs to replace the IGUs to calculate the estimated warranty liability, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. As disclosed by management, a material weakness existed related to this matter. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The procedures included, among others, (i) testing management\u2019s process for determining the specific warranty liability for certain IGUs; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the estimate; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the statistical model used to estimate the number of affected IGUs expected to fail in the remaining warranty period, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the convergence thresholds used in the statistical model and the estimated costs to replace the IGUs. Evaluating the reasonableness of the estimated costs to replace IGUs included, among others, evaluating estimated manufacturing costs through assessment of historical production volumes and costs and evaluating historical and forecasted third-party cost information. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the statistical model used by management as well as the convergence thresholds used within the statistical model. \n\nRevenue Recognition \u2013Estimates of Costs to Complete View Smart Building Platform Contracts \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into contracts with the Smart Building Platform customers, which are typically the owners, tenants or developers of buildings, or the general contractor acting on behalf of the Company\u2019s customers. Given that the Company is responsible for providing the service of integrating each of the inputs into a single combined output and the Company controls that output before it is transferred to the customer, the Company is the principal in the arrangement, and will recognize the entire arrangement fee as its revenue, with any fees that it pays to its subcontractors recognized in its cost of revenue. As the Company performs a significant service of integrating the promised goods and services into a combined output, these contracts constitute a single, combined performance obligation. Management determines the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received, which is the contract price. The Company recognizes revenue over time using a cost-to-cost input method where progress on the performance obligation is measured by the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total costs expected to complete the contract. Recognizing revenue using a cost-to-cost input method provides an objective measure of progress and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer. Management judgment is required to estimate the progress towards completion. Significant changes in this estimate could affect the profitability of the Company\u2019s contracts. Changes to estimated profit on contracts are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contract\u2019s progress towards fulfillment of the performance obligation. When the total estimated costs for a contract exceed contracted revenue, an accrual for the loss on the contract is recognized as cost of revenue at the time of contract execution. As actual costs are incurred that are in excess of revenue recognized, they are recorded against the loss accrual, which is therefore reduced. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a total of $12.0 million for initial contract loss accruals, of which the balance of estimated contract losses for work that had not yet been completed totaled $15.0 million as of December 31, 2022. Revenues relating to the Smart Building Platform contracts were $55.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - estimates of costs to complete View Smart Building Platform contracts is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the total costs expected to complete View Smart Building Platform contracts, and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the estimates of total costs expected to complete arrangements where revenue is recognized over time. As disclosed by management, a material weakness existed related to this matter. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) evaluating and testing \n\nmanagement\u2019s process for determining the total costs expected to complete, which included evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates of total forecasted manufacturing costs and third party subcontractors costs for selected arrangements, (ii) testing the accuracy and completeness of costs incurred to date, and (iii) testing the appropriateness of the timing and amount of revenue recognized based on the underlying inputs and estimates. Evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates of total costs expected to complete included performing a comparison of management\u2019s prior period cost estimates to actual costs incurred. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nSan Jose, California \n\nMarch 31, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2013. \n\nView, Inc. \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n\n( in thousands, except share and per share data) \n\n \n\n December 31, 2022 2021 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 95,858 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811856/000181185623000003/view-20221231.htm"}, "2021": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": NaN, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": ["Commitments and Contingencies Indemnifications From time to time, the Company enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the Company to indemnify the Company's officers, directors, and employees for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship. Generally, a maximum obligation under these contracts is not explicitly stated. Because the maximum amounts associated with these agreements are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company has not been required to make payments under these obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Standby Letter of Credit During the course of business, the Company's bank issues standby letters of credit on behalf of the Company to certain vendors and other third parties of the Company. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total value of the letters of credit issued by the bank are $16.5 million and $11.5 million, respectively. No amounts have been drawn under the standby letter of credit. Commitments In June 2021, the Company entered into a promissory note with one of its customers pursuant to which the customer may draw amounts in a maximum aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. The amount of the draws are limited to amounts incurred by subcontractors contracted by View in relation to the project. The note is not a revolving facility, which means that outstanding amounts under the note that are repaid cannot be re-borrowed. The promissory note has a maturity date set at the fourth anniversary of the date of the first advance to the customer. The promissory note bears no interest during the period between the first advance to the customer and the maturity date, with interest increasing to an annual rate of 3.5% thereafter. As of December 31, 2021, the customer has made zero advances on the promissory note. Litigation Settlements The Company previously alleged claims for legal malpractice in relation to legal representation and related services provided by a law firm to the Company in connection with certain corporate matters. Both the Company and the law firm settled their dispute via a mediation regarding claims alleged by the Company against the law firm and signed a formal written settlement agreement in December 2019. Per the terms of the signed agreement, the law firm agreed to pay an amount of $22.5 million as consideration to settle the dispute. The Company recorded $22.5 million as income reflecting the recovery of previously incurred losses from the legal settlement in the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company received this amount in January 2020. Litigation From time to time, the Company is subject to claims, litigation, internal or governmental investigations, including those related to labor and employment, contracts, intellectual property, environmental, regulatory compliance, commercial matters and other related matters, some of which allege substantial monetary damages and claims. Some of these actions may be brought as class actions on behalf of a class or purported class of employees. The Company is also defendants in judicial and administrative proceedings involving matters incidental to our business. Legal expenses are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues a charge when management determines that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a loss is probable, the Company records an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. When no point of loss is more likely than another, the Company records the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and discloses the estimated range. The Company does not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies, but does disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and the Company is able to estimate such a range. If the Company cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses, the Company explains the factors that prevent it from determining such a range. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to it to determine whether an accrual should be established or adjusted. The ultimate outcome of legal proceedings involves judgments, estimates, and inherent uncertainties and cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the ultimate outcome of any legal matter be unfavorable, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. The Company may also incur substantial legal fees, which are expensed as incurred, in defending against legal claims. Securities Litigation On August 18, 2021, plaintiff Asif Mehedi filed a putative securities class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ( Mehedi v. View, Inc. f/k/a CF Finance Acquisition Corp. II et al. (No. 5:21CV06374, N.D. Cal.)) alleging violations of the federal securities laws by the Company, Rao Mulpuri, and Vidul Prakash. The complaint alleges that defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder) and that Mulpuri and Prakash violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint asserts claims on behalf of a putative class of persons who acquired the Company\u2019s stock between November 30, 2020 and August 16, 2021. The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose to investors that the Company had not properly accrued warranty costs related to its product; that there was a material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting related to warranty accrual; that the Company\u2019s financial results for prior periods were misstated as a result; and that defendants\u2019 positive statements about the Company\u2019s business were materially misleading. The complaint alleges that the foregoing statements caused the price of the Company\u2019s stock to be inflated and that class members were damaged when the price of the Company\u2019s stock declined on August 16, 2021, when the Company announced an independent investigation concerning the adequacy of the Company\u2019s previously disclosed warranty accrual. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages and costs, including attorneys\u2019 and expert fees. On February 8, 2022, the Court appointed Stadium Capital LLC lead plaintiff and denied the competing motion of Sweta Sonthalia. On March 14, 2022, Ms. Sonthalia filed a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus, asking the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to vacate the lead plaintiff order. On April 11, 2022, the district court denied Ms. Sonthalia\u2019s motion to stay proceedings in the district court pending disposition of the writ petition. The writ petition is now fully briefed in the Ninth Circuit and is being considered for oral argument in August, September, or October 2022. Pursuant to a stipulated schedule, Stadium Capital will file an amended complaint no later than 30 days after View files its Restatement with the SEC; defendants will file an answer or motion(s) to dismiss within 60 days of the filing of the amended complaint; Stadium Capital will file its opposition(s) to the motion(s) within 30 days of the filing of the motion(s) to dismiss; and defendants will file any reply in support of the motion(s) to dismiss within 30 days of the filing of the opposition brief. Given the early stage of this matter, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss (or range of loss), if any, at this time; therefore, a liability has not been recorded as of December 31, 2021. Derivative Litigation On December 6, 2021, a purported Company shareholder filed a verified stockholder derivative complaint (nominally on behalf of the Company) against Rao Mulpuri, Nigel Gormly, Harold Hughes, Tom Leppert, Toby Cosgrove, Lisa Picard, Julie Larson-Green, and Vidul Prakash ( Jacobson v. Mulpuri, et al. (No. 1:21CV01719, D. Del.)). The complaint alleges that Mulpuri and Prakash violated Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act, and asserts claims against the director defendants for breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets. The complaint alleges that defendants Mulpuri, Gormly, Hughes, Leppert, Cosgrove, Picard, and Larson-Green failed to prevent the Company from making false statements regarding the Company\u2019s business results and prospects and that the Company has been harmed by incurring legal fees and potential liability in investigations and lawsuits. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and costs, a judgment directing the Company to reform its corporate governance and internal procedures, and unspecified restitution from defendants to the Company. On February 14, 2022, the Court entered the parties\u2019 stipulation staying the litigation until fifteen days after the earliest of: (a) dismissal with prejudice of the Mehedi v. View securities class action and exhaustion of all appeals, or dismissal by settlement; (b) the motion(s) to dismiss Mehedi v. View are denied; or (c) either party gives notice that it no longer consents to the stay. On May 24, 2022, a different purported Company shareholder filed another verified stockholder derivative complaint (nominally on behalf of the Company) against Mulpuri, Gormly, Hughes, Leppert, Cosgrove, Picard, Larson-Green, and Prakash ( Damidi v. Mulpuri et al. (No. 1:22CV00675, D. Del.)). The complaint asserts claims for violation of Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets. The complaint alleges that defendants Mulpuri, Gormly, Hughes, Leppert, Cosgrove, Picard, and Larson-Green failed to prevent the Company from making false statements regarding the Company\u2019s business results and prospects and that the Company has been harmed by incurring legal fees and potential liability in investigations and lawsuits. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and costs, punitive damages, and unspecified restitution from defendants to the Company. The Damidi action has been docketed as related to the Jacobson action. Given the early stage of this matter, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss (or range of loss), if any, at this time; therefore, a liability has not been recorded as of December 31, 2021. Government Investigation On November 9, 2021, the Company announced that it had voluntarily reported to the SEC that the Audit Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors was conducting an independent, internal investigation into the adequacy of the Company\u2019s previously reported warranty accrual. In January 2022, the Company was informed that the SEC is conducting a formal investigation of this matter. The Company has cooperated with the SEC\u2019s investigation and intends to continue doing so. Given the early stage of this matter, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss (or range of loss), if any, at this time; therefore, a liability has not been recorded as of December 31, 2021. Northern District of Mississippi Environmental Matter In September and August of 2021, the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality (\u201cMCEQ\u201d), Desoto County Regional Utility Authority (\u201cDCRUA\u201d) and the City of Olive Branch, Mississippi (\u201cOlive Branch\u201d), each issued notices and orders to the Company with respect to its discharges of water from its Olive Branch facility into the publicly owned treatment works (\u201cPOTW\u201d) of DCRUA and Olive Branch without first obtaining a pretreatment permit. In August 2021, a Subpoena to Testify Before a Grand Jury was issued out of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi (\u201cSubpoena\u201d) to the Company requiring it to produce to the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) various documents relating to environmental matters at its Olive Branch facility, including but not limited to hazardous waste records, air emissions records, storm water discharges records and wastewater disposal records. The Company has cooperated fully with each such notice, order and Subpoena. On April 13, 2022, the Company and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi agreed in principle to the terms of a global settlement resolving the prospect of claims and charges against the Company relating to all prior discharges of water into the POTW of DCRUA and Olive Branch without first obtaining a pretreatment permit. The principal terms of the settlement are: (1) the Company pleading guilty to a single misdemeanor count for negligently discharging wastewater to a POTW without first obtaining a pretreatment permit in violation of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(c)(1)(A); (2) the Company paying a fine of $3.0 million over a three-year period in equal installments of $1.0 million to the federal government; (3) the Company paying a special assessment of $125 to the federal government pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013(a)(1)(B); (4) the Company entering a separate civil Agreed Order with the MCEQ that requires the payment of a separate civil penalty of $1.5 million; (5) the Company making a separate community service payment in the amount of $0.5 million to DCRUA, to be used for the sole purpose of expanding wastewater treatment capacity in DeSoto County, Mississippi, within 30 days of entering the Plea Agreement; (6) the Company implementing an environmental management system that conforms to ISO 14001:2015 standards or a similar environmental management system approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which is expected to result in $0.3 million in consulting and personnel costs; (7) the Company implementing agreed upon wastewater reduction plans, which is expected to result in approximately $2.0 million in capital expenditures to install a wastewater treatment and recycling system; (8) the Company obtaining a pretreatment permit from MDEQ, or entering an Agreed Order with MCEQ and operating in compliance with that Agreed Order until a permit can be obtained; (9) the Company obtaining wastewater discharge permits from DCRUA and Olive Branch, or entering into Consent/Compliance Order(s) or Agreement(s) with DCRUA and Olive Branch that are consistent with any Agreed Order entered with MCEQ and operating in compliance with such Consent/Compliance Order(s) or Agreement(s) until permits can be obtained; and (10) the Company agreeing to probation for three years. The terms of the Plea Agreement are subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. View is in the process of coordinating with MDEQ and the local authorities with respect to the civil orders and/or agreements contemplated by the settlement terms, including obtaining a pretreatment permit from MCEQ, which has not been granted as of the date of this Report. The Plea Agreement will be presented to the Court for approval following these efforts. The date for presentation of the Plea Agreement to the Court has not yet been determined. The Company has recognized the $5.0 million of penalties it expects to incur in conjunction with this settlement within Other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is included within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of December 31, 2021."]}, "Debt": {"Debt": ["Debt Debt outstanding consisted of the following (in thousands): Interest Rate - December 31, December 31, 2021 2021 2020 Term loan, due June 30, 2032 0% $ 15,430 $ 15,430 Revolving debt facility, repaid on March 8, 2021 LIBOR+ 9.05% \u2014 250,000 Debt discount \u2014 (2,752) Total debt 15,430 262,678 Debt, current 1,470 247,248 Debt, non-current $ 13,960 $ 15,430 Principal payments on all debt outstanding as of December 31, 2021 are estimated as follows (in thousands): Year Ending December 31, Total 2022 $ 1,470 2023 1,470 2024 1,470 2025 1,470 Thereafter 9,550 Total $ 15,430 Term Loan On November 22, 2010, the Company entered into a debt arrangement with a lender, in an amount of $40.0 million (\"Term Loan\"), for the purpose of financing equipment and tenant improvements at its manufacturing facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. Pursuant to the original terms, the loan provides for interest-free debt to be repaid in semi-annual payments due on June 30 and December 31 each year. The loan was originally being paid over 24 semi-annual installments through June 30, 2024. On October 22, 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated debt arrangement with the lender. The amended and restated debt arrangement temporarily suspended the payments. Starting June 30, 2022, the Company is required to make semi-annual payments of $0.7 million through June 30, 2032. The term loan agreement required the Company to invest certain amounts in land, building and equipment and create a certain number of jobs. The term loan agreement, as amended, also includes a covenant for audited consolidated financial statements to be delivered to the lender within 210 days of the Company\u2019s fiscal year end. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. Equipment Loan In June 2017, the Company entered into an Equipment Loan Agreement with a lender for a committed facility up to $60.0 million (Equipment Loan), within which $20.0 million was subject to further approval by the lender. In 2017, the Company drew down proceeds of $40.0 million in the form of promissory note. The loan bore interest at a rate of 12.25% to 12.5% per annum, compounded on a monthly basis and is payable over 48 months with principal payments starting the 13th month from the drawdown date. The last months principal and interest amount were paid in advance. The loan contained an end of term balloon payment of $5.6 million and the facility fees are $0.3 million each year until the secured obligations are paid in full. The loan is collateralized by specific fixed assets purchased with the proceeds. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded interest expense of $4.8 million. In October 2019, the loan and end of term balloon amount were repaid in full prior to its maturity. Upon the prepayment of the term loan, the Company recorded $3.0 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss. Revolving Debt Facility In October 2019, the Company entered into a secured revolving debt facility pursuant to which the Company may draw amounts in a maximum aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million until January 3, 2020 and $250.0 million after such date, for the purpose of paying payables and other corporate obligations. In October 2019, the Company drew a principal amount of $150.0 million under the facility with weekly maturity dates ranging from 8 days to 364 days. In May 2020, the Company drew the remaining principal amount of $100.0 million available under the facility, which was repayable on May 1, 2021. The facility's original expiration was October 22, 2023, at which time all drawn amounts were to be repaid in full. The interest rate applicable to amounts outstanding under the facility was LIBOR, plus 9.05%. As security for the payment and performance of all obligations under the facility, the Company granted the finance provider a security interest in substantially all of the Company's assets. Under the original agreement, repaid principal amounts became immediately available to be redrawn under the facility with maturity dates of one year through October 23, 2022. As of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s available borrowing capacity was nil. As of December 31, 2020, the Company classified the outstanding balance of $250.0 million as a current liability because the Company was in violation of the stockholders\u2019 equity covenant as of such date and the limited waiver from the finance provider waived such violation only through March 31, 2021. In December 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to replace thirteen weekly draws of approximately $2.9 million each, aggregating to $37.5 million in principal amount, with four notes of approximately $9.4 million each, aggregating to $37.5 million in principal amount. On March 8, 2021, upon Closing, the facility was repaid in full in the amount of $276.8 million, including accrued interest and future interest through maturity of the notes of $26.8 million prior to the expiration of the limited waiver from the finance provider. Upon repayment of its obligation, the Company recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $10.0 million, and the facility was terminated."]}, "external_audit": "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID No. 238 ) \n\nConsolidated Financial Statements: Consolidated Balance Sheets \n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss \n\nConsolidated Statements of Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders\u2019 Equity (Deficit) \n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of View, Inc. \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of View, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, of redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit) and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 appearing under Item 15(2) (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO because material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to the Company not designing or maintaining (i) an effective control environment, specifically the Company (a) did not have a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate degree of accounting knowledge and experience to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters and lacked related internal controls necessary to satisfy accounting and financial reporting requirements and (b) did not demonstrate a commitment to integrity and ethical values; (ii) effective controls in response to the risks of material misstatement, including designing and maintaining formal accounting policies, procedures, and controls over significant accounts and disclosures to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including with respect to revenue and receivables, inventory, equity and derivative liabilities, warranty-related obligations, leasing arrangements, property, plant, and equipment, stock-based compensation, and period-end financial reporting; and (iii) effective controls over information technology general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, including effective controls over program change management, user access, computer operations and program development. \n\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses referred to above are described in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered these material weaknesses in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the December 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements. \n\nRestatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements \n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has restated its 2020 and 2019 financial statements to correct misstatements. See also the \u201cProduct Warranties - Specific Warranty Liability for Certain Insulating Glass Units\u201d critical audit matter. \n\nSubstantial Doubt about the Company\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern \n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has not achieved profitable operations or positive cash flows from operations since its inception that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. \n\nChange in Accounting Principle \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2021. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management's report referred to above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nProduct Warranties - Specific Warranty Liability for Certain Insulating Glass Units \n\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2019, the Company identified a quality issue with certain material purchased from one of its suppliers utilized in the manufacturing of certain Insulating Glass Units (IGU). The Company stopped using the affected materials upon identification of the quality issue in 2019. The Company has replaced and expects to continue to replace the affected IGUs for the remainder of the period covered by the warranty. Management developed a statistical model to analyze the risk of failure of the affected IGUs related to this quality issue and predict the potential number of future failures that may occur during the remaining warranty period, as well as the timing of the expected failures. Management judgment is necessary to determine the distribution fit and covariates utilized in the statistical model, as well as the relative tolerance to declare convergence. The statistical model considered the volume of units sold, the volume of \n\nunit failures, data patterns, and other characteristics associated with the failed IGUs as well as the IGUs that had not yet failed as of each financial reporting period. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, time to failure, manufacture date, location of installation, and environmental factors. Based on this analysis, management has recorded a specific warranty liability using the estimated number of affected IGUs expected to fail in the remaining warranty period and applying estimated costs management expects to incur to replace the IGUs based on warranty contractual terms and business practices. Considering the uncertainty inherent in the failure analysis, including the actual timing of the failures and the number of defective IGUs, as well as uncertainty regarding future supply chain costs and production volumes that may impact the projected costs to replace defective IGUs in future years, it is reasonably possible that the amount of costs to be incurred to replace the defective IGUs could ultimately be materially different from the estimate. The total warranty liability included $36.2 million as of December 31, 2021, related to these IGUs. See also the \u201cRestatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements\u201d section of our report. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the specific warranty liability for certain IGUs is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the specific warranty liability for certain IGUs due to the use of a statistical model to estimate the affected IGUs expected to fail in the remaining warranty period and the judgment required to estimate the costs to replace the affected IGUs, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management\u2019s estimate of affected IGUs expected to fail in the remaining warranty period and to evaluate the significant assumptions related to the convergence thresholds used in the statistical model, and the forecasted production volume and the estimated costs to replace the IGUs to calculate the estimated warranty liability, (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge, and (iv) as described in the \u201cOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\u201d section, material weaknesses were identified related to this matter. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The procedures included, among others, (i) testing management\u2019s process for determining the specific warranty liability for certain IGUs; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the estimate; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the statistical model used to estimate the number of affected IGUs expected to fail in the remaining warranty period, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the convergence thresholds used in the statistical model, and the forecasted production volume and the estimated costs to replace the IGUs. Evaluating the reasonableness of the estimated costs to replace IGUs included, among others, evaluating forecasted production volumes and estimated manufacturing costs through assessment of historical production volumes and costs, available production capacity and future sales demand and evaluating historical and forecasted third-party cost information. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the statistical model used by management as well as the convergence thresholds used within the statistical model. \n\nRevenue Recognition \u2013Estimates of Costs to Complete View Smart Building Platform Contracts \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2021, the Company entered into and commenced work on the first contract under its new product offering, View Smart Building Platform. In these types of arrangements, the Company contracts with the Smart Building Platform customers, which are typically the owners, tenants or developers of buildings, or the general contractor acting on behalf of the Company\u2019s customers. Given that the Company is responsible for providing the service of integrating each of the inputs into a single combined output, the Company controls that output before it is transferred to the customer and accordingly, the Company is the principal in the arrangement, and will recognize the entire arrangement fee as its revenue, with any fees that it pays to its subcontractors recognized in its cost of revenue. As the Company performs a significant service of integrating the promised goods and services into a combined output, these contracts constitute a single, combined performance obligation. Management determines the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received, which is the contract price. The Company recognizes revenue over time using a cost-to-cost input method where progress on the performance obligation is measured by the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total costs expected to complete the contract. Recognizing revenue using a cost-to-cost input method provides an objective measure of progress and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer. Management judgment is required to estimate the progress towards completion. Significant changes in this estimate could affect the profitability of the Company\u2019s contracts. Changes to estimated profit on contracts are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contract\u2019s progress towards fulfillment of the performance obligation. When the total estimated costs for a contract exceed contracted revenue, an accrual for the loss on the contract is recognized as cost of revenue at the time of contract execution. As actual costs are incurred that are in excess of revenue recognized, they are recorded against the loss accrual, which is therefore reduced. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a total of $34.4 million for initial contract loss accruals, of which the balance of estimated contract losses for work that had not yet been completed totaled $20.7 million as of December 31, 2021. Revenues relating to the Smart Building Platform contracts were $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - estimates of costs to complete View Smart Building Platform contracts is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the total costs expected to complete View Smart Building Platform contracts, (ii) a high degree \n\nof auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the estimates of total costs expected to complete arrangements where revenue is recognized over time, and (iii) as described in the \u201cOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\u201d section, material weaknesses were identified related to this matter. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) evaluating and testing management\u2019s process for determining the total costs expected to complete, which included evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates of total forecasted manufacturing costs and third party subcontractors costs for selected arrangements, (ii) testing the accuracy and completeness of costs incurred to date, and (iii) testing the appropriateness of the timing and amount of revenue recognized based on the underlying inputs and estimates. Evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates of total costs expected to complete included performing a comparison of management\u2019s prior period cost estimates to actual costs incurred. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nSan Francisco, California \n\nJune 15, 2022 \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2013. \n\nView, Inc. \n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets \n\n( in thousands, except share and per share data) \n\n \n\n December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 (As Restated) Assets: Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 281,081 \u00a0", "URL": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811856/000181185622000017/view-20211231.htm"}}, "TGLS": {"2022": {"Summary of Significant Accounti": NaN, "Commitments and Contingencies": {"Commitments and Contingencies": [" Note 17.
