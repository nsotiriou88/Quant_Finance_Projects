## Intro

Udacity Portfolio Projects.

## Parts

### Term 1

1. **Trading with Momentum**

    In this project, we implement a trading strategy, and test to see if it has the potential to be profitable. We will be supplied with a universe of stocks and time range. We will also be provided with a textual description of how to generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. We will then compute the signal for the time range given and apply it to the dataset to produce projected returns. Finally, we will perform a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude if there is alpha in the signal. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.

2. **Breakout Strategy**

    In this project, we will implement the breakout strategy. We'll find and remove any outliers. We'll test to see if it has the potential to be profitable using a Histogram and P-Value. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.

3. **Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimisation**

    In this Project we utilise Smart Beta trading strategy and also try to optimise the Portfolio to track an Index. We search for the minimum of a convex function with contraints that will help to minimise the tracking errror of the ETF against the Index.

4. **Multi-factor Model**

    In this project, we will build a statistical risk model using PCA. We'll use this model to build a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors. We'll create these factors, then evaluate them using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. At the end of the project, we'll optimize the portfolio using the risk model and factors using multiple optimization formulations. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.

### Term 2

5. **NLP on Financial Statements**

    In this project, we'll do NLP Analysis on 10-k financial statements to generate an alpha factor. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia and Loughran-McDonald sentiment word lists.

6. **coming**

## Others

There is also a Monte Carlo Simulation script for _Value at Risk Model (VaR)_.

The data samples for some of the quiz sections are stored on the Google and OneDrive drives (eg. `.csv`, `.zip`).
